      How Betterment Manages Risks in Your Portfolio  Betterment’s tools can keep you on track with the best chance of reaching your goals. Investing always involves some level of risk. But you should always have control over how much risk you take on. When your goals are decades away, it's easier to invest in riskier assets. The closer you get to reaching your goals, the more you may want to play it safe. Betterment’s tools can help manage risk and keep you on track toward your goals. In this guide, we’ll: Explain how Betterment provides allocation advice Talk about determining your personal risk level Walk through some of Betterment’s automated tools that help you manage risk Take a look at low-risk portfolios The key to managing your risk: asset allocation Risk is inherent to investing, and to some degree risk is good. High risk, high reward, right? What’s important is how you manage your risk. You want your investments to grow as the market fluctuates. One major way investors manage risk is through diversification. You’ve likely heard the old cliche, “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” This is the same reasoning investors use. We diversify our investments, putting our eggs in various baskets, so to speak. This way if one investment fails, we don’t lose everything. But how do you choose which baskets to put your eggs in? And how many eggs do you put in those baskets? Investors have a name for this process: asset allocation. Asset allocation involves splitting up your investment dollars across several types of financial assets (like stocks and bonds). Together these investments form your portfolio. A good portfolio will have your investment dollars in the right baskets: protecting you from extreme loss when the markets perform poorly, yet leaving you open to windfalls when the market does well. If that sounds complicated, there’s good news: Betterment will automatically recommend how to allocate your investments based on your individual goals. How Betterment provides allocation advice At Betterment, our recommendations start with your financial goals. Each of your financial goals—whether it’s a vacation or retirement—gets its own allocation of stocks and bonds. Next we look at your investment horizon, a fancy term for “when you need the money and how you’ll withdraw it.” It’s like a timeline. How long will you invest for? Will you take it out all at once, or a little bit at a time? For a down payment goal, you might withdraw the entire investment after 10 years once you’ve hit your savings mark. But when you retire, you’ll probably withdraw from your retirement account gradually over the course of years. What if you don’t have a defined goal? If you’re investing without a timeline or target amount, we’ll use your age to set your investment horizon with a default target date of your 65th birthday. We’ll assume you’ll withdraw from it like a retirement account, but maintain a slightly riskier portfolio even when you hit the target date, since you haven’t decided when you'll liquidate those investments. But you’re not a “default” person. So why would you want a default investment plan? That’s why you should have a goal. When we know your goal and time horizon, we can determine the best risk level by assessing possible outcomes across a range of bad to average markets. Our projection model includes many possible futures, weighted by how likely we believe each to be. By some standards, we err on the side of caution with a fairly conservative allocation model. Our mission is to help you get to your goal through steady saving and appropriate allocation, rather than taking on unnecessary risk. How much risk should you take on? Your investment horizon is one of the most important factors in determining your risk level. The more time you have to reach your investing goals, the more risk you can afford to safely take. So generally speaking, the closer you are to reaching your goal, the less risk your portfolio should be exposed to. This is why we use the Betterment auto-adjust—a glide path (aka formula) used for asset allocation that becomes more conservative as your target date approaches. We adjust the recommended allocation and portfolio weights of the glide path based on your specific goal and time horizon. Want to take a more aggressive approach? More conservative? That’s totally ok. You’re in control. You always have the final say on your allocation, and we can show you the likely outcomes. Our quantitative approach helps us establish a set of recommended risk ranges based on your goals. If you choose to deviate from our risk guidance, we’ll provide you with feedback on the potential implications. Take more risk than we recommend, and we’ll tell you we believe your approach is “too aggressive” given your goal and time horizon. Even if you care about the downsides less than the average outcome, we’ll still caution you against taking on more risk, because it can be very difficult to recover from losses in a portfolio flagged as “too aggressive.” On the other hand, if you choose a lower risk level than our “conservative” band, we'll label your choice “very conservative.” A downside to taking a lower risk level is you may need to save more. You should choose a level of risk that’s aligned with your ability to stay the course. An allocation is only optimal if you’re able to commit to it in both good markets and bad ones. To ensure you’re comfortable with the short-term risk in your portfolio, we present both extremely good and extremely poor return scenarios for your selection over a one-year period. How Betterment automatically optimizes your risk An advantage of investing with Betterment is that our technology works behind the scenes to automatically manage your risk in a variety of ways, including auto-adjusted allocation and rebalancing. Auto-adjusted allocation For most goals, the ideal allocation will change as you near your goal. We use automation to make those adjustments as efficient and tax-friendly as possible. Deposits, withdrawals, and dividends can help us guide your portfolio toward the target allocation, without having to sell any assets. If we do need to sell any of your investments, our tax-smart technology minimizes the potential tax impact. First we look for shares that have losses. These can offset other taxes. Then we sell shares with the smallest embedded gains (and smallest potential taxes). Betterment’s auto-adjusted allocation not only saves you time, but it also gives you a smooth, tax-efficient path from higher risk to lower risk. Rebalancing Over time, individual assets in a diversified portfolio move up and down in value, drifting away from the target weights that help achieve proper diversification. The difference between your target allocation and the actual weights in your current portfolio is called portfolio drift. A high drift may expose you to more (or less) risk than you intended when you set the target allocation. Betterment automatically monitors your account for rebalancing opportunities to reduce drift, although rebalancing will likely not occur at a lower account balance. There are several different methods depending on the circumstances: Cash flow rebalancing generally occurs when cash flows going into or out of the portfolio are already happening. We use inflows (like deposits and dividend reinvestments) to buy asset classes that are under-weight. This reduces the need to sell, which in turn reduces capital gains taxes. And we use outflows (like withdrawals) by seeking to first sell asset classes that are overweight. Sell/buy rebalancing reshuffles assets that are already in the portfolio. When cash flows can’t keep your portfolio’s drift within 3% percentage points (or 5% percentage points for portfolios that contain mutual funds), we try to sell just enough of overweight asset classes to buy underweight asset classes and reduce the drift to zero. A couple exceptions exist, and those are when we attempt to avoid realizing short term capital gains within taxable accounts or wash sales. Allocation change rebalancing occurs when you change your target allocation. This sells securities and could possibly realize capital gains, but we still utilize our tax minimization algorithm to help reduce the tax impact. We’ll let you know the potential tax impact before you confirm your allocation change. Once you confirm it, we’ll rebalance to your new target with minimized drift. How Betterment reduces risk in portfolios Short-term US treasuries and short-term high quality bonds can help reduce risk in portfolios. At a certain point, however, including assets such as these in a portfolio no longer improves returns for the amount of risk taken. For Betterment, this point is our 43% stock portfolio. Portfolios with a stock allocation of 43% or more don’t incorporate these exposures. We include our U.S. Ultra-Short Income ETF and our U.S. Short-Term Treasury Bond ETF in the portfolio at stock allocations below 43% for both the IRA and taxable versions of the Betterment Core portfolio strategy. If your portfolio includes no stocks (meaning you allocated 100% bonds), we can take the hint. You likely don’t want to worry about market volatility. So in that case, we recommend that you invest everything in these ETFs. At 100% bonds and 0% stocks, a Betterment Core portfolio consists of 80% U.S. short-term treasury bonds and 20% U.S. short-term high quality bonds. Increase the stock allocation in your portfolio, and we’ll decrease the allocation to these exposures. Reach the 43% stock allocation threshold, and we’ll remove these two funds from the recommended portfolio. At that allocation, they decrease expected returns given the desired risk of the overall portfolio. Short-term U.S. treasuries generally have lower volatility (any price swings are quite mild) and smaller drawdowns (shorter, less significant periods of loss). The same can be said for short-term high quality bonds, but they are slightly more volatile. It’s also worth noting that these two asset classes don’t always go down at exactly the same time. By combining the two, we’re able to produce a two-fund portfolio with a higher potential yield while maintaining relatively lower volatility. As with other assets, the returns for assets such as high quality bonds include both the possibility of price returns and income yield. Generally, price returns are expected to be minimal, with the primary form of returns coming from the income yield. The yields you receive from the ETFs in Betterment’s 100% bond portfolio are the actual yields of the underlying assets after fees. Since we’re investing directly in funds that are paying prevailing market rates, you can feel confident that the yield you receive is fair and in line with prevailing rates.

      Investing in Your 50s: 4 Practical Tips for Retirement Planning  In your 50s, assess your retirement plan, lifestyle, earnings, and support for family. Practice goal-based investing to help meet your objectives. As you enter your 50s, you may feel like your long-term goals are coming within reach, and it’s up to you to make sure those objectives are realized. Now is also a perfect time to see how your investments and retirement savings are shaping up. If you’ve cut back on savings to meet big expenses, such as home repairs and (if you have children) college tuition, you now have an opportunity to make up lost ground. You might also think about how you want to live after you retire. Will you relocate? Will you downsize or stay put? If you have children, how much are you willing to support them as they enter adulthood? These decisions all matter when deciding how to strategize your investments for this important decade of your life. Four Goals for Your 50s Your 50s can be a truly productive and efficient time for your investments. Focus on achieving these four key goals to make these years truly count in retirement. Goal 1: Assess Your Retirement Accounts If you’ve put retirement savings on the back burner, or just want to make a push for greater financial security—the good news is that you can make larger contributions toward employer retirement accounts (401(k), 403(b), etc.) at age 50 and over, thanks to the IRS rules on catch-up contributions. If you’re already contributing the maximum to your employer plans and still want to save more for retirement, consider opening a traditional or Roth IRA. These are individual retirement accounts that are subject to their own contribution limits, but also allow for a catch-up contribution at age 50 or older. You may also wish to simplify your investments by consolidating your retirement accounts with IRA rollovers. Doing so can help you get more organized, streamline recordkeeping and make it easier to implement an overall retirement strategy. Plus, by consolidating now, you can help avoid complications after age 72, when you’ll have to make Required Minimum Distributions from all the tax-deferred retirement accounts you own. Goal 2: Evaluate Your Lifestyle and Pre-Retirement Finances When you’re in your 50s, you may still be a ways from retirement, however you’ll want to consider how to support yourself when you do begin that stage of your life. If you’ve just begun calculating how much you’ll need to save for a comfortable retirement, consider the following tips and tools. Tips and Tools for Estimating Income Needs Make a rough estimate of how much you spend on housing, food, utilities, health care, clothing, and incidentals. Nowadays, tools such as Mint® and Prosper include budgeting features that can help you see these expenditures. Subtract what you can expect to receive from Social Security. You can estimate your benefit with this calculator. Subtract any defined pension plan benefits or other sources of income you expect to receive in retirement. Subtract what you can safely withdraw each year from your retirement savings. Consider robust retirement planning tools, which can help you understand how much you’ll need to save for a comfortable retirement based on current and future income from all sources, and even your location. If there’s a gap between your income needs and your anticipated retirement income, you may need to make adjustments in the form of cutting expenses, working more years before retiring, increasing the current amounts you’re investing for retirement, and re-evaluating your investment strategy. Think About Taxes Your income may peak in your 50s, which can also push you into higher tax brackets. This makes tax-saving strategies like these potentially more valuable than ever: Putting more into tax-advantaged investing vehicles like 401(k)s or traditional IRAs. Donating appreciated assets to charities. Implementing tax-efficient investment strategies within your investments, such as tax loss harvesting* and asset location. Betterment automates both of these strategies and offers features to customers with no additional management fee. Define Your Lifestyle Your 50s are a great time to think about your current and desired lifestyle. As you near retirement, you’ll want to continue doing the things you love to do, or perhaps be able to start doing more and build on those passions. Perhaps you know you’ll be traveling more frequently. If you are socially active and enjoy entertainment activities such as dining out and going to the theater, those interests likely won’t change. Instead, you’ll want to enjoy doing all the things you love to do, but with the peace of mind knowing that you won’t be infringing on your retirement reserves. Say you want to start a new business when you leave your job. You’re not alone; more than a third of new entrepreneurs starting businesses in 2021 were between the ages of 55 and 64 according to research by the Kauffman Foundation. To get ready, you’ll want to start building or leveraging your contacts, creating a business plan, and setting up a workspace. You may also wish to consider relocating during retirement. Living in a warmer part of the country or moving closer to family is certainly appealing. Downsizing to a smaller home or even an apartment could cut down on utilities, property taxes, and maintenance. You might need one car instead of two—or none at all—if you relocate to a neighborhood surrounded by amenities within walking distance. If you sell your primary home, you can take advantage of a break on capital gains —even if you don’t use the money to buy another one. If you’ve lived in the same house for at least two out of the last five years, you can exclude capital gains of up to $250,000 per individual and $500,000 per married couple from your income taxes, according to the IRS. Goal 3: Chart Your Pre-Retirement Investment Strategy After you’ve determined how much you’ll need for a comfortable retirement, now’s also a good time to begin thinking about how you’ll use the assets you’ve accumulated to generate income after you retire. If you have shorter-term financial objectives over the next two to five years—such as paying for your kids’ college tuition, or a major home repair—you’ll have to plan accordingly. For these milestones, consider goal-based investing, where each goal will have different exposure to market risk depending on the time allocated for reaching that goal. Goal-based investing matches your time horizon to your asset allocation, which means you take on an appropriate amount of risk for your respective goals. Investments for short-term goals may be better allocated to less volatile assets such as bonds, while longer-term goals have the ability to absorb greater risks but also achieve greater returns. When you misallocate, it can lead to saving too much or too little, missing out on returns with too conservative an allocation, or missing your goal if you take on too much risk. Setting long investment goals shouldn’t be taken lightly. This is a moment of self-evaluation. In order to invest for the future, you must cut back on spending your wealth now. That means tomorrow’s goals in retirement must outweigh the pleasures of today’s spending. If you’re a Betterment customer, it’s easy to get started with goal-based investing. Simply set up a goal with your desired time horizon and target balance and Betterment will recommend an investment approach tailored to this information. Goal 4: Set Clear Expectations with Children If you have children, there’s nothing more satisfying than watching your kids turn into motivated adults with passions to pursue. As a parent, you’ll naturally want to prepare them with everything you can to help them succeed in the world. You may be wrapping up paying for their college tuition, which is no easy feat given that these costs – even at public in-state universities – now average in the tens of thousands of dollars per year. As your kids move through college, take the time to have a serious discussion with them about what they plan to do after graduation. If graduate school is on the horizon, talk to them about how they’ll pay for it and how much help from you, if any, they can expect. Unlike undergraduate programs, graduate programs assess financial aid requirements by looking at only the student’s assets and incomes, not the parents’, so your finances won't be considered. You’ll also want to set expectations about other kinds of support—such as any help in paying for their health insurance premiums up to a certain age, or their mobile phone plan, or even whether toward major purchases like a home or car. It’s great to help out your children, but you’ll want to make sure you’re not jeopardizing your own security. Your 50s may demand a lot from you, but taking the time to properly assess your investments, personal financial situation, lifestyle, and, if applicable, your support for children, can be truly rewarding in your retirement years. By tackling these four goals now, you can help set yourself up to meet your current responsibilities and increase your chances of a more financially secure and comfortable life in the decades to come.

      How Betterment Keeps Your Investments Safe  Betterment uses a variety of protections to secure your investments and your overall account. Here’s the security you get with us. When you choose to invest it with us, that’s a responsibility we don’t take lightly. At Betterment, we’re proud to have a variety of protections in place to secure your investments and your overall account. In this guide, we’ll: Walk through our safety measures Talk about how two-factor authentication keeps your account secure Define SIPC insurance What safety measures does Betterment take? Betterment goes to great lengths to help keep your assets secure. Betterment is a regulated entity, and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as an investment adviser. Many aspects of our operations, and all aspects of our advice, are subject to the SEC’s oversight. We make it easy to verify your investment holdings At Betterment, we believe in transparency. You can not only own independently-verifiable securities from companies like Vanguard and iShares, but you can view your precise positions in these investments at all times. Just log into your account from any device to view your previous day’s performance. Every day and after every trade, we disclose the precise number of shares of every ETF in which you’re invested. Our policy of transparency also extends to our dividends reports and tax statements. We not only show the transactions made on your behalf, but we also list each fractional share sold and the respective gross proceeds and cost basis for each. We regularly undergo review by the SEC and FINRA Betterment LLC, our SEC-registered investment advisor, provides investment advice and discretionary management of your account. Betterment’s affiliate, Betterment Securities, provides custody and execution services for Betterment’s client accounts. Betterment Securities is both a carrying and introducing broker-dealer registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”), whose sole purpose is to service Betterment’s clients and carry accounts that Betterment manages. Betterment Securities maintains books and records for all our customers' assets, and regulatory agencies routinely review those records. For example, Betterment is subject to rule 206(4)-2 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”), which means we receive an annual surprise exam from an independent public accountant. We never know when it’ll happen. They just show up unannounced. The auditors verify our internal books and records. They reconcile every share and every dollar we say we have against our actual holdings. They spot check several hundred random customer accounts. They contact customers to verify that the account statements we issue match our internal records. And they ask questions if anything is even a penny off. But don’t just take our word for it! You can verify their audits yourself. Our partner clearing brokerage firm also keeps its own records of all of the assets we manage for our clients, and we reconcile our records to our clearing firm’s reports on a daily basis, providing an additional independent source of verification. We also undergo regular, rigorous, independent examination, both by the SEC and by FINRA, to ensure that we properly maintain our customer records and satisfy our capital requirements. Our regulators scrutinize our revenues, expenses, and available capital on a monthly basis. Three separate annual audits by our independent public accountants verify the adequacy of our financial condition, the safety of our operational controls, and the safekeeping of customer assets we custody. Each examination ensures that our records match up with the independently available records from our clearing firm. We never commingle funds No matter what investment adviser or brokerage firm you use, they should never mix your money with their firm’s operational funds. At Betterment, our operational funds are always 100% separate from customer funds held by Betterment Securities. Customer funds are kept apart by numerous firewalls—both digital and human-supervised. We built our software from the ground up to make any sort of commingling impossible, automating all of our trading and money movement. We also avoid risky financial operations that some other retail brokers engage in, such as proprietary trading with operating capital, or lending out customer assets. We only do one thing: manage your money. How does two-factor authentication keep your account secure? One of the most important ways we protect your investments is by making it difficult for someone else to gain access to your account. Passwords are notoriously easy to crack. That’s why our Betterment engineers implemented two-factor authentication across retail client accounts, simplifying and strengthening our authentication code in the process. As a side note, certain Advised client accounts and 401(k) participant accounts through our Betterment at Work offering don’t require mandatory 2FA at this time. Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra level of security by requesting two separate pieces of evidence to verify a user’s identity. You’ve likely come across it before. Have you ever entered your password in an app or website, then been instructed to type in a code that was texted to your phone? That’s one form of two-factor authentication. Such text-based verification codes are actually less secure than some other forms of 2FA, but any form of 2FA is exponentially more secure than a password alone. At Betterment, we offer two forms of 2FA: The text-based verification codes you’re likely used to More secure time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) using an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy While we hope you’ll consider taking advantage of the extra security that comes with TOTP, either form of 2FA will help keep your account well-protected. What is SIPC insurance? Much like other forms of insurance, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) provides a safety net in case of emergency. Betterment Securities, our affiliated broker-dealer, is a member of SIPC. Health insurance exists to cover your medical needs. Car insurance helps you get you back on the road after an accident. And SIPC insurance protects your investments in the event of a worst-case scenario such as brokerage firm insolvency, covering up to $500,000 of missing assets (securities and cash), including a maximum of $250,000 for cash claims. But unlike most insurance, you don’t have to seek out and pay for SIPC on your own. All brokers—including Betterment—are required to be SIPC members. SIPC insurance only protects against missing securities. It does not cover losses due to market volatility. How SIPC Insurance Works The $500,000 coverage limit applies individually to legally distinct accounts. If you have a taxable account, an IRA, and a trust, each one is eligible for its own $500,000 of coverage. And that coverage applies to what’s missing, not to the overall balance. Let’s say you have accounts with three different brokers, and each account holds $2 million in assets. Each of those accounts is covered separately by SIPC, up to $500,000. If one of those brokerage firms were to go bankrupt, a judge would appoint a trustee to sort through the broker’s books and distribute assets back to you and other clients. Here are some possible outcomes, with specific numbers to illustrate: The trustee recovers your original assets (your $2 million) from the insolvent broker-dealer. You are made whole and experience zero loss on your account. SIPC is not involved in this scenario. The trustee only recovers $1.5 million of your assets. The remaining $500,000 is covered by SIPC insurance, and you are made whole. The trustee only recovers $1 million. You are covered by SIPC insurance for $500,000 of the missing amount, but you incur a partial loss for the remaining $500,000. Why it’s unlikely you’ll need SIPC As important as this protection is, chances are, you won’t actually need it. Custodian broker-dealers are required to undergo a series of regulatory safety checks and audits everyday and report any problems. This elaborate set of guardrails helps ensure that SIPC remains a last resort. For example, brokers must segregate their own assets from their clients’ assets. If this segregation is properly maintained, account holders should be made whole in case of firm insolvency—no matter the account size. Brokers must also closely monitor their net capital cushion, providing similar protection. Because of all this, SIPC proceedings are very rare. Since the organization was established in 1971, there have only been 330 proceedings out of approximately 40,000 SIPC brokers. In the first four years, 109 proceedings were initiated, and since then, no year has had more than 13. Secure your investments with Betterment All investing comes with some risk. But your risk should be based on the market, not your broker. We can’t control every up and down of the market, but we can and do take every precaution to keep your assets secure. Betterment employs principles of transparency, simplicity, and verification from the ground up to provide you with state-of-the-art security. As a major financial institution, we’re required to keep a large capital cushion, maintain our own records, and undergo extensive examination by regulators and public accountants. But we never put our financial cushion at risk, and we never let customer assets out of our hands. That's why you can trust us to keep your investments safe.

    <p class="item-excerpt">Investing even a modest amount now can make a noticeable difference down the road.</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Why Saving for Your Kid's College isn’t a Pass-Fail Proposition  Investing even a modest amount now can make a noticeable difference down the road. In the long list of priorities during the early years of parenting, saving for your kid’s college may fall somewhere between achieving rock-hard abs and learning a foreign language. It’s not usually high on the list, in other words. And while the number of 529 plans, a tax-advantaged investing account designed for education expenses, continues to grow (15.7 million), that still makes for less than 1 plan for every 4 people under the age of 18 according to the latest U.S. Census numbers. The relative lack of saving in this space should come as no surprise when you factor in the financial commitments of early childhood—daycare alone can feel like a second mortgage—but the statistic also presents an opportunity. Start saving for college a few years earlier, or even at all, and that’s more time for compound interest to potentially work its magic. The stakes are high considering the skyrocketing costs of college. Before we dive into some practical budgeting tips to address this topic, let’s pour out some whole milk for the unique struggle that is saving while also supporting a family. A financial planner’s first-person account from the parenting front lines Bryan Stiger became the proud father of a baby girl last year. He also just so happens to be a Betterment Certified Financial Planner™. So he’s uniquely situated to talk about the money management challenges facing heads of households. “Since becoming a parent, it’s been a rollercoaster for me and my wife for sure,” says Bryan. “A few other things that feel like a rollercoaster when you become a parent are your expenses and your savings.” A big part of the problem is that kids create a financial double whammy, Bryan says. They appear suddenly and start demanding, among other things, a share of your limited money supply. At the same time, they introduce a series of potential new savings goals. Think not only a college education but more immediate big ticket items like braces. When you heap these goals on top of your pre-existing ones, it can quickly feel overwhelming. So how do you save for them all? Bryan suggests you don’t. Pick and prioritize only a handful, he advises, then define those goals more clearly. While this is a personal decision, his recommended order of importance for clients usually goes something like: Retirement (contribute just enough to get your employer’s full 401(k) match, assuming they offer one) Short-term, high-priority goals High-interest debt (any loans at 6% and above) Emergency fund (3-6 months’ worth of living expenses) Retirement (come back to your tax-advantaged 401(k) and/or IRA and work to max them out) Other (home, college, etc.) Your kid’s college fund, as you can see, shouldn’t come before your personal goals. That’s because you can usually finance an education, but few banks will finance your retirement. That doesn’t mean your hopes of helping your kid with college are doomed, however. The key, according to Bryan, is to first size up your priority goals. This involves crunching some numbers and answering “How much?” and “How soon?” for each goal. In the case of college, “How much” will depend on a few factors, decisions like private vs public, in-state vs out, etc. A calculator tool such as this one from calculator.net can help you with a rough estimate. &nbsp; In terms of “How soon?”—or in finance-speak, your “time horizon”—we recommend using the year your kid turns 22. That’s because parents tend to continue saving for college while their kids are enrolled. Once you have a rough idea of these two numbers, Betterment’s tools can tell you how much you should contribute each month to help increase your likelihood of meeting your goal. Do this for each of your priorities, and you very well might find you don’t have enough cash flow to cover them all. This is normal! Bryan likes to remind clients in these moments that short-term goals, by nature, won’t soak up their cash flow forever, especially if they doggedly pursue them. Once met, you can redirect that money to other pursuits like a down payment on a house – or your kid’s college. Above all, forgive yourself if you fall short When it comes to saving for your child’s education, two things are true: You have precious few years from an investing perspective for compound growth to potentially work its magic. You may not be able to save as much as you’d like—or at all in the beginning—due to higher priorities. Given these realities, it’s okay to lower the bar. If you’re still working on high-interest debt and/or an emergency fund, set a goal of achieving those in 2-5 years so you can focus elsewhere afterwards. Or set up a seemingly small recurring deposit toward an education goal now. It could be $10, $25, or $50 a month. It can still make a difference down the road. If you ease your child’s student loan burden by even a little, you’ll have done them a huge favor. It’s a favor they probably won’t fully appreciate for a while, but since when was parenting anything but a thankless job?

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      How Betterment’s Tech Helps You Manage Your Money  Our human experts harness the power of technology to help you reach your financial goals. Here’s how. When you’re trying to make the most of your money and plan for the future, financial advisors are really helpful. But there are some things humans simply can’t do as well as algorithms. And investing is an area where automation and digital tools can help improve your outcomes and make advanced strategies more accessible. Here at Betterment, we’re all about using technology—with human experts at the helm—to manage your money smarter and help you meet your financial goals. In this guide, we’ll Explore the concept of a “robo-advisor” Talk about Betterment’s human approach to technology Share how we help your investing avoid idle cash Share how our tech helps you plan for the future Show how you can access additional advice A quick primer on the rise of robo-advisors There’s a word for the investment firms who first used technology in new and exciting ways in the service of everyday investors: robo-advisors. By letting their human experts and technology do what each does best, robo-advisors provide some key benefits: Optimized time.Robo-advisors use algorithms and automation to do all the busy work, optimizing your investments faster than a human can. The result: you spend less time managing your finances and more time enjoying your life. Lower fees.Because of their efficiency, robo-advisors cost less to operate, which translates to savings for you. While the specific fees vary from one robo-advisor to the next, they all tend to be a fraction of what it costs to work with a traditional investment manager. Lower barriers to entry.Almost anyone with Internet access can use a robo-advisor. No special expertise required. And you don’t need a big minimum investment to get started. Personalized recommendations.Robo-advisors help you focus on your specific reasons for saving, adjusting your risk based on your timeline and target amount. Robo-advisors do the heavy lifting behind the scenes, managing all the data analysis and adapting investment expertise to fit your circumstances. All you need to do is fill in the gaps with details about your financial goals. If you have the time to research, implement and routinely manage your own investment strategy, you still can, but you don’t have to. That’s the beauty of working with a robo-advisor. The experience is as hands-on as you want it to be. Or you can relax in the knowledge your investments are in good hands, so you can simply live your life. How we combine human expertise with technology Automation is what we’re known for. But our team of financial experts is our secret sauce. They research, prototype, and implement all the advice and activity that you see in your account. Our algorithms and tools are built on the expertise of traders, quantitative researchers, tax experts, CFP® professionals, behavioral scientists, and more. Then we use technology to help accurately and consistently execute your investment strategy. Our automated processes manage your portfolio, monitoring for opportunities to rebalance and then rebalancing once accounts cross a $50 threshold if it drifts too far from your target allocation, and executing any tax strategies you’ve enabled. Technology also lets us put all of your deposits to work and avoid idle cash. Keep reading for more on that. How we automate to help you avoid the cost of idle cash Cash is an essential part of our financial lives. You can’t pay for this week’s groceries with stock, after all. And it may reassure you to keep your emergency fund in cash, although we’d politely point out you have other options to consider there. But there’s little benefit to letting cash sit idle in your investing accounts. That’s because it’s missing out on potential market returns, while at the same time losing value in times of inflation, which is most times. This double whammy can mean serious setbacks in achieving long-term investing success. That’s why we use technology to invest every penny of yours put toward a portfolio of ETFs. Here’s how: We automatically reinvest the dividends your investments pay out. Dividends are the cash earnings companies regularly distribute to shareholders. We purchase fractions of shares on your behalf, meaning if you deposit enough money to purchase 2 ⅔ shares of an ETF, that’s exactly how many shares you’ll get. For years, many investing firms would round up or down to the nearest whole share and leave the remaining cash idle in your account. Speaking of other brokerage firms, you may still have investing accounts with some. So what’s an investor to do in that case? Well, if you connect these external accounts to Betterment, we can highlight each of your external portfolio’s total idle cash. We hope this information is a starting point that helps you decide whether it’s worth it to transfer that money to a different firm. How we help you plan for the future Nobody knows the future. And that makes financial planning tough. Your situation can change at any time. And we can’t predict how external factors like markets, inflation, or tax rates may shift. But that doesn’t mean you should give up and stop planning. Our tools and advice can help you see how various changes could affect your goals. We show you a range of potential outcomes so you can make more informed decisions. We estimate how market performance may affect your investments Financial experts use many different methods to estimate future returns of a portfolio. Many financial calculators simply assume a constant average return. This is usually based on historical returns of a benchmark, like the S&amp;P 500 index. But there are several problems with assumptions like this: You aren’t usually invested exactly like the benchmark. Different mixes of stocks and bonds or other assets in your portfolio will result in different ranges of outcomes. You probably have multiple financial goals, each with their own time horizons. The different risk allocations for each goal shouldn’t have the same returns assumption. Assumptions based on a historical estimate are sensitive to the time horizon used to calculate them. At Betterment, we’ve made three improvements to this method to make more accurate estimates: We use a return estimate for the specific portfolio you select for each goal. For example, our estimate for a 90% stock portfolio is different from our estimate for an 85% stock portfolio. Each is based on the asset classes you actually hold. We factor market volatility into our estimates. This produces the range of returns you see on the goal forecaster. For example, our savings estimates assume a somewhat conservative 40th percentile outcome (60% chance of success) rather than the simple average (50% chance of success). We assume that a risk-free component of expected returns can vary over time. When interest rates rise (or fall), so should your expected returns. We consider the impact of tax rates We may not be able to predict future tax rates, but we can be pretty sure that certain incomes and account types will be subject to some taxes. This becomes especially relevant in retirement planning, where taxes affect which account types are most valuable to you (such as a traditional IRA or Roth IRA) and your current and future income. Here’s how we estimate tax rates for your accounts: We use the latest tax data available. We always update federal tax information on January 1. State tax rate information is harder to come by, but we update it as soon as possible. Historically, that has been six to twelve months into the year. Tax bracket ranges are typically adjusted for inflation, so we assume that inflation by itself will not cause major changes to your tax rate. Your income will likely be different in the future, and that will affect your tax rate. So we use income increases due to inflation and typical salary growth to estimate what your future tax rate might be. We allow tax deduction and dependent overrides, which can affect your personal rate. We plan ahead for inflation We don’t know how inflation will change, but we can reference known historical ranges, as well as targets set by fiscal policy. The most important thing is to factor in some inflation—especially for long-term goals like retirement—because we know it won’t be zero. We currently assume a 2% inflation rate in our retirement planning advice and in our safe withdrawal advice, which is what the Fed currently targets. Getting additional advice At Betterment, we automate what we can, and leave the rest to humans. Machines are ideal for rule-based decisions, calculations at scale, and data-aggregation. But people are usually better at complex decisions, abstract thoughts, and flexibility in logic and inputs. Human advisors are much better at behavioral coaching, building advice models, and dealing with complex financial situations. So we complement our automated advice with access to our financial planning experts through advice packages or our Premium plan, which offers unlimited calls and emails with our team of CFP® professionals. Whether you need a one-time consultation or ongoing support, you can always discuss your unique financial situations with one of our licensed financial professionals. Managing your money with Betterment Our mission is to empower you to make the most of your money, so you can live better. Sometimes the best way to do that is with human creativity and critical thought. Sometimes it’s with machine automation and precision. Usually, it takes a healthy dose of both.

      Why Donating Shares Is A Smart Way To Give To Charity  Donating shares lets you avoid paying taxes on capital gains, and you can still deduct the value of your gift on your tax return. In 1 minute There are many different ways for you to give back to your community. For example, giving directly to individuals in poverty, donating cash to charities, and volunteering your time are all well-known and worthwhile options. As an investor, you may have access to an option that comes with significant potential advantages: You can donate qualifying appreciated shares—or in other words, shares that are worth more today than when you acquired them. When you donate in the form of cash, you can deduct the value of that donation on your tax return. And that’s great! But by donating cash, you could be missing out on an additional tax incentive. Donate appreciated shares instead, and you could also avoid paying taxes on capital gains. That means your donation goes further while spending the same amount. And yes, you still get to deduct the value of those gifted shares on your tax return—as long as you’ve held them for at least a year. However, you should be aware that the deduction may not be exactly the same value. The IRS calculates the tax-deductible value of those shares as the average of the highest price and the lowest price on the day you made the transfer. Sometimes that means the deductible value ends up being slightly lower than the exact value you donated. Other times it ends up being slightly higher, giving you yet another benefit! But either way, the amount you save by avoiding the capital gains tax can exceed the differences in valuation. Boost your charitable giving by donating shares. In 5 minutes In this guide, we’ll: Explore donating shares instead of cash Explain how the IRS calculates these deductions Show you how Betterment makes donating shares easy You’ve been investing, planning for your future and becoming financially secure, and you’d like to pay it forward. That’s great! There are many ways to give back to your community. You might donate to charitable organizations. You might give cash directly to those in need. Or you might give of your time by volunteering. As an investor, you have a charitable super power. You can make your gifts go further and enjoy tax benefits at the same time. Why you should consider donating shares instead of cash When you have assets that have gained value, donating cash means you may not be making the most of your gift. Donations in the form of eligible shares offer two main advantages: You won’t pay capital gains taxes on the shares you donate You can deduct the value of your gift on your tax return Since you get more tax benefits, your money can stretch further. You have more left over to donate, invest, or use as you see fit. How the IRS calculates these deductions When you donate a share, you do so at a certain point in time, with an associated price. For greatest tax efficiency, you generally should only donate shares you’ve held for at least one year. At that point, the IRS lets you claim a deduction for the whole, appreciated value up to 30% of adjusted gross income. However, the price at the time of your gift isn’t necessarily the same value that’s deducted on your tax return. The IRS rules say the deductible amount for your tax filing must be the “fair market value.” And the IRS determines the fair market value by taking the average of the highest price and lowest price on the day of the transfer. Say you donate $1,000 worth of shares: 20 shares worth $50 each. During the day of your donation, the shares trade at a high price of $51 and a low of $47. The IRS will call the fair market value of all twenty shares $980. That $980 is the deductible value when you file your taxes for the year. So keep in mind that the value you plan to donate won’t necessarily match the exact value you can deduct on your taxes. However, while the numbers may be slightly lower or higher than you initially expect, the value of saving on capital gains tax by donating appreciated shares and then being able to deduct that value to lower your taxes even further, generally exceeds any differences in valuation during the day of transfer. Betterment makes donating shares easy We believe that donating securities should be as easy as donating cash. You’re trying to make a difference. You shouldn’t have to worry about math or forms. No snail mail. No walking into an office. So we streamlined the process. Here’s how: We track how much of your account is eligible to give to charity. Betterment automatically reports the amount eligible for donation, assessing which shares of your investments have been held for more than one year, and which of those have the most appreciation. We estimate the tax benefits of your gift. Before you complete a donation, we’ll let you know the expected deductible amount and potential capital gains taxes saved. We move assets from your account to a charitable organization’s account. No paperwork! With a traditional broker, your gift would have to move from your account to the organization’s brokerage account, which involves time and paperwork. But Betterment offers charities investment accounts with no advisory fees—on up to $1 million of assets—to make the gift process seamless. We provide a tax receipt once the donation is complete. We’ll email the receipt to you, and you’ll also be able to access it from your Betterment account at any time. Additionally, we take on most of the reporting for our partner charities, letting them devote their resources more efficiently to the causes you support, rather than to administrative tasks. We partner with highly-rated charities across a range of causes. These include nonprofits such as the World Wildlife Fund, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and Givewell. Log in to your Betterment account to see the full list. Don’t see your preferred charity? Put in a request to add them! Gifting securities to charity, rather than donating cash, is a strategy that wealthy philanthropists have been employing for decades to save on capital gains taxes. We hope to democratize these benefits by helping everyday Americans use the same exact tax-saving method. Join our community of altruistic investors today and make the most of your charitable donations! If you’re already a Betterment customer, log in to donate your appreciated shares.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      How Socially Responsible Investing Connects to Your Values  Learn more about this increasingly-popular category of investments and our approach to it. Socially responsible investing—or SRI for short—is an increasingly popular option for people looking to invest in companies that are striving to create a positive social and environmental impact on the world. With SRI, everyday investors can influence markets and invest in the change they want to see. This category of investing is booming with a total of $35 trillion in assets according to Bloomberg—and it goes by many names: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing Sustainable investing Values-based investing No matter what it’s called, though, SRI is built on the same idea. It considers both a company’s returns and its impact on the world. In this guide, we’ll summarize our approach to SRI as well as address questions on the performance of the category in general. Meet our SRI portfolios How the $VOTE fund is shaking up shareholder activism How SRI’s performance stacks up Meet our SRI portfolios Using the principles of SRI, you can buy into like-minded organizations via hundreds or even thousands of stocks, funds, and portfolios. But we try to make investing simple at Betterment. So we did the legwork for you and built three impact-focused SRI portfolios to choose from, one designed for a broad impact and two others tuned specifically to climate and social criteria. All three are diversified, cost-efficient, and built for the long-term, just like our Core portfolio. Broad Impact A popular choice for anyone interested in overall change, Broad Impact increases your exposure to companies that rank highly on all ESG criteria. We use the Core Portfolio as a foundation and replace the market capitalization funds (standard funds based on the size of companies) with SRI alternatives in four classes: U.S. Stocks; Emerging Market Stocks; Developed Market Stocks; U.S. High Quality Bonds and U.S. Corporate Bonds. We also increase the proportion of stocks of companies deemed to have strong social responsibility practices, brands you might recognize such as Intel, Cisco, and Disney. Climate Impact The portfolio for the eco-conscious investor, Climate Impact, uses funds that include stocks with more climate-conscious alternatives and divest from owners of fossil fuel reserves. A global green bond fund is also included in the construction of this portfolio. This puts the focus on companies working to lower carbon emissions and fund green projects. Social Impact The portfolio for the equality-minded investor, Social Impact, uses Broad Impact as a foundation while adding two funds, one focused on gender diversity ($SHE) and another on minority empowerment ($NACP). These two funds are some of the only ones of their kind. The NACP fund, in fact, is the only ETF of its kind. We won’t go into the full methodology of these portfolios here. To sum up our approach, we analyze hundreds of low-cost ETFs and choose funds that have an ESG mandate. These funds may, for example, be focused on selecting companies that rank highly on ESG factor scores from a data provider such as MSCI, an industry-leading provider of financial data and ESG analytics that has served the financial industry for more than 40 years. The funds that are incorporated into Betterment’s SRI portfolios not only meet these criteria but also maintain our signature diversification and cost considerations. Finally, our team of investing experts is never satisfied. It’s why Betterment’s SRI offering continues to evolve since we first introduced it in 2017. We continue to search for new funds and updated standards that increase impact and deliver better performance. For an example of this evolution, look no further than $VOTE, a groundbreaking fund that’s included in all of our SRI portfolios. How the $VOTE fund is shaking up shareholder activism On the surface, the $VOTE ETF looks a lot like a garden variety index fund tracking the S&amp;P 500. Behind the scenes, however, it represents an innovative approach to pushing companies toward environmental and social practices. How? Through a process called “proxy voting.” Purchasing stock in a company grants you not just a share of its potential profits, but also the right to vote on certain aspects of its decision-making at annual shareholder meetings. If you hold stock of a company through an index fund, however, the fund technically holds this right. The rise of index fund investing has meant a lot of this power goes untapped. That started to change in 2021, when the investment firm Engine No. 1 launched $VOTE with the aim of harnessing indexes for shareholder activism. The firm stunned the corporate world that year by persuading a majority of ExxonMobile shareholders—despite only holding just .02% of the company’s shares itself—to install three new board members in the name of reducing the energy company’s carbon footprint. With each new investment in $VOTE, the potential for more headlines grows. By tracking the highest-valued companies proportionately (aka market cap weighted) and charging a management fee of only .05%—among the lowest in the industry—$VOTE is designed for mass adoption. How SRI’s performance stacks up Speaking of performance, it’s a frequently asked and totally reasonable question when it comes to socially responsible investing in general. Does trying to do right by the world through your investments limit their potential for growth? The answer is becoming increasingly clear: not likely. According to a survey of 1,141 peer-reviewed papers and other similar meta-reviews, the performance of SRI funds has “on average been indistinguishable from conventional investing.” And while the researchers note that “finance is not a static field, so it is likely that these propositions will evolve,” they also found evidence that socially responsible investing may offer “downside” protection in times of social or economic crisis such as pandemics. Investing in a better world There was a time when SRI was barely on the radar of everyday investors. If you did know about it, you likely had one of two options: Spend a good amount of time researching individual stocks for a DIY SRI portfolio. Spend a handsome amount to buy into one of the few funds on the market. Thankfully, those days are in the past. It’s never been easier and is becoming more affordable to express your values through your investing. And we’re proud to help to make it possible. At Betterment, there’s no separate tier of access for our SRI portfolios. All of our customers can choose socially responsible investing at the same simplified management fee. If you’re ready to give socially responsible investing a try, we’re ready.

      Cash Reserve Has A Variable APY: What That Means For You  Interest rates change over time, but at Betterment, we are always working hard to give you competitive rates so you can make the most of your money. Note: mention of Cash Reserve is inclusive of money held in cash goals. Our objectives are aligned with yours: we want to grow your money. Cash Reserve is an account that is different from the savings accounts that you might find at traditional banks. We’re not tied to one specific bank, so we have the opportunity to obtain attractive rates in the marketplace. We use our size and scale to access a network of program banks, and then we use our technology and efficiency to pass rates on directly on to you. Is that rate guaranteed? No, it’s variable, and that’s by design. The Federal Funds Rate influences interest rates across all banks. As rates change, so will the Cash Reserve rate. You can feel confident that Betterment is always working to offer you competitive interest rates, no matter what the current rate environment may be. See what the current variable interest rate is for Cash Reserve. How does Betterment provide competitive&nbsp;rates? Similar to how we select the&nbsp;ETFs in each asset class for your portfolio, we work with a number of program banks to provide you competitive rates. Often, these rates are more competitive than what you could get as an individual depositor. When you deposit with Betterment, you become part of a larger community of savers. Banks can more efficiently support our customer base as a group, rather than as individuals. What causes interest rates to change? No matter where you bank, the prevailing interest rate environment will have an impact on your interest rate. The amount banks are willing to pay on deposits is heavily influenced by the Federal Reserve, which sets the rate at which banks can loan money to each other. This is known as the Federal Funds Rate. It’s the rising tide that raises all rates, and the receding tide that can also bring them all down. The Federal Reserve sets a target range for the Federal Funds Rate, rather than aiming for a specific number. Because of this, the Federal Funds Rate can change by a small amount from day to day. However, larger changes to the Federal Funds Rate can occur when the Federal Reserve changes its target range or when the Federal Reserve changes policies. The interest rate you receive on Cash Reserve typically will change as a result of these more significant shifts in the Federal Funds Rate. What will future rates look like? If the Federal Reserve lowers its target range, the interest rate on Cash Reserve will generally change by a similar amount. You can expect this to impact rates at other banks as well. We Do What We Believe Is Best For You As your advisor and as a smart money manager, it’s in our DNA to do what we believe is best for you. We’ve spent the past decade working to optimize your investments and provide you with advice that helps you reach your long-term financial goals, and we are excited to partner with you to make the most of your money with our newest cash management solution—Cash Reserve.

      The Betterment Portfolio Strategy  We continually improve the portfolio strategy over time in line with our research-focused investment philosophy. TABLE OF CONTENTS I. Prerequisites for a Betterment Portfolio Strategy II. Achieving Global Diversification with a Better Approach to Asset Allocation III. Increasing Value with Evidence-based Portfolio Optimization IV. Manage Taxes Using Municipal Bonds Conclusion Citations Betterment has a singular objective: to help you make the most of your money, so that you can live better. Our investment philosophy forms the basis for how we pursue that objective: Betterment uses real-world evidence and systematic decision-making to help increase our customers’ wealth. In building our platform and offering individualized advice, Betterment’s philosophy is actualized by our five investing principles. Regardless of one’s assets or specific situation, Betterment believes all investors should: Make a personalized plan. Build in discipline. Maintain diversification. Balance cost and value. Manage taxes. In this in-depth guide to the Betterment Portfolio Strategy, our goal is to demonstrate how the Betterment Portfolio Strategy, in both its application and development, contributes to how Betterment carries out its investing principles. How we select funds to implement the Strategy is also guided by our investing principles, and is covered separately in our Investment Selection Methodology paper. Within this paper, you will find that our portfolio construction process strives to define a strategy that is diversified, increases value by managing costs, and enables good tax management—three key investing principles. Of these, portfolio strategy construction is most particularly concerned with diversification. And that’s where most investment managers stop—diversifying a portfolio across asset classes. We don’t. As you’ll see in this paper, our prerequisites and iterative portfolio optimization process enable us to construct the portfolio strategy as one piece of a larger holistic investing approach where personalized planning, cost management, tax optimization, and discipline each are achieved through different methodologies. At the end of this paper, we will touch on the complementary processes we use in our investment process and how they work together to help our customers maximize their wealth. I. Prerequisites for a Betterment Portfolio Strategy When developing a portfolio strategy, any investment manager faces two main tasks: asset class selection and portfolio optimization. We’ll provide a guided tour of how we pursue each of Betterment’s investing principles and, in effect, accomplish each task along the way in crafting the Betterment Portfolio Strategy. Laying a Foundation for Personalized Planning &amp; Discipline To align with Betterment’s investing principles, a portfolio strategy must enable personalized planning and built-in discipline for investors. If the Betterment Portfolio Strategy—when standing alone—cannot reasonably be applied to an investor’s specific goal and situation, then it fails to help Betterment achieve its principle of helping customers formulate a personalized plan. If a portfolio strategy seems unintuitive or causes poor investor behavior, then we have failed to build in discipline. The Betterment Portfolio Strategy is comprised of 101 individualized portfolios, in part, because that level of granularity in allocation management provides the flexibility to align to multiple goals with different timelines and circumstances. This helps to lay a foundation for the principles of personalized planning and built-in discipline. While Betterment solves for these principles in other ways as well, their manifestation starts with portfolio strategy itself. II. Achieving Global Diversification with a Better Approach to Asset Allocation An optimal asset allocation is one that lies on the efficient frontier, which is a set of portfolios that seek to achieve the maximum objective for the lowest amount of risk. The objective of most long-term portfolio strategies is to maximize return, while the associated risk is measured in terms of volatility—the dispersion of those returns. In line with our investment philosophy of making systematic decisions backed by research, Betterment’s asset allocation is based on a theory by economist Harry Markowitz called Modern Portfolio Theory, as well as subsequent advancements based on that theory.1 Introduced in 1952, Markowitz’ work was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1990 after his theoretical framework and mathematical modeling informed decades of improvements in portfolio strategy construction. While there remains enormous debate (and entire sectors of financial services) devoted to portfolio construction and optimization, many practitioners rely on Markowitz’ theoretical framework to evaluate returns and measure risk for asset allocation. It’s also a very intuitive framework for constructing a portfolio strategy. The major insight posited by Markowitz is that any asset included in a portfolio should not be assessed by itself, but rather, its potential risk and return should be analyzed as a contribution to the whole portfolio. This is mathematically expressed as an optimization of maximizing expected returns while penalizing those returns for risk. Using this insight as the objective of portfolio construction is just one way of building portfolios; other forms of portfolio construction may legitimately pursue other objectives, such as optimizing for income, or minimizing loss of principal. However, our portfolio construction goes beyond traditional Modern Portfolio Theory in five important ways: Estimating forward looking returns Estimating covariance Tilting specific factors in the portfolio Accounting for estimation error in the inputs Accounting for taxes in taxable accounts Each of these additions to basic Modern Portfolio Theory will be explained in full later in this paper. Asset Classes Selected for the Betterment Portfolio Strategy Any asset allocation strategy starts with the universe of investable assets. Leaning on the work of Black-Litterman, the universe of investable assets for us is the global market portfolio.2 However, the global market portfolio is, in some sense, not well-defined, and, often, definitions depend on the context of the application. Below we describe the assets that compose our global market portfolio and, hence, the Betterment Portfolio Strategy. To capture the exposures of the asset classes for the global market portfolio, we rely on the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available that represent each class in the theoretical market portfolio. We base our asset class selection on ETFs because this aligns the portfolio construction with our subsequent process, our investment selection methodology. Equities Developed Market Equities We select U.S. and international developed market equities as a core part of the portfolio. Historically, equities exhibit a high degree of volatility, but provide some degree of inflation protection.3 Even though significant historical drawdowns, such as the global financial crisis of 2008, demonstrate the possible risk of investing in equities, longer-term historical data and our forward expected returns calculations suggests that developed market equities remain a core part of any asset allocation aimed at achieving positive returns.4 This is because, over the long term, developed market equities have outperformed bonds on a risk-adjusted basis. Within developed market equities, the following sub-asset classes are included in the Betterment Portfolio Strategy: Equities representing the total market of the United States Equities representing the total international developed market Emerging Market Equities To achieve a global market portfolio, we also include equities from less developed economies, called emerging markets. Generally, consistent with the research of others, our analysis shows that emerging market equities tend to be more volatile than U.S. and international developed equities. And while our research shows high correlation between this asset class and developed market equities, their inclusion on a risk-adjusted basis is important for global diversification. Note that we exclude frontier markets, which are even smaller than emerging markets, due to their widely varying definition, extreme volatility, small contribution to global market capitalization, and cost to access. Bonds Bonds have a low correlation with equities historically. Because of this, they remain an important way to dial down the overall risk of a portfolio. To leverage various risk and reward tradeoffs associated with different kinds of bonds, we include the following sub-asset classes of bonds in the Betterment Portfolio Strategy. Short-term treasury bonds Inflation protected bonds Investment grade bonds International bonds Municipal bonds Emerging market bonds Figure 1. Correlation between Asset Classes in the Betterment Portfolio Strategy Figure 1.&nbsp;This figure demonstrates the correlation of each asset class relative to each other, using historical data from April 2007 to December 2016. A sample covariance matrix was calculated and then modified by the shrinkage method explained in this paper. The source of data for each asset class is Yahoo! Finance (a specific ETF represents each asset class). Asset Classes Excluded from the Betterment Portfolio Strategy While Modern Portfolio Theory would have us craft the Betterment Portfolio Strategy to represent the total market, including all available asset classes, we exclude some asset classes whose cost and/or lack of data outweighs the potential benefit gained from their inclusion in the portfolio strategy. For this reason, we have excluded private equity, commodities, and natural resources, since estimates of their market capitalization are unreliable, and there is a lack of data to support their historical performance. Our chosen model for assessing the rate of return for a given asset also suggests that asset classes such as these may not show sensitivity to total portfolio returns.5 While commodities represent an investable asset class in the global financial market, we have excluded the class of ETFs from the Betterment Portfolio Strategy for several reasons—most importantly, their low contribution to a global stock/bond portfolio's risk-adjusted return. In addition, real estate investment trusts (REITs), which tend to be well marketed as a separate asset class, are not explicitly included in the portfolio strategy. We include exposure to real estate, but as a sector within equities. Adding additional real estate exposure by including a REIT asset class would overweight the portfolio strategy’s exposure to real estate relative to the overall market. III. Increasing Value with Evidence-based Portfolio Optimization While asset selection sets the stage for a globally diversified portfolio strategy, to increase performance value at a reasonable cost (without sacrificing diversification) we must further optimize the portfolio strategy. This process requires tilting the portfolio strategy in ways that our analysis shows could lead to higher returns. While most asset managers offer a limited set of model portfolios at a defined risk scale, the Betterment Portfolio Strategy is designed to give customers more granularity and control over how much risk they want to take on. Instead of offering a conventional set of three portfolio choices—aggressive, moderate, and conservative—our portfolio optimization methods enable the Betterment Portfolio Strategy to contain 101 different portfolios. Optimizing Portfolios to Help Increase Returns Modern Portfolio Theory requires estimating returns and covariances to optimize for portfolios that sit along an efficient frontier. While we could use historical averages to estimate future returns, this is inherently unreliable because historical returns do not necessarily represent future expectations. A better way is to utilize the Capital Asset Pricing Model along with a utility function which allows us to optimize for the portfolio with a higher&nbsp;return for the risk that the investor is willing to accept. Computing Forward-Looking Return Inputs To compute forward-looking returns for the Betterment Portfolio, we instead turn to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which assumes all investors aim to maximize their expected return and minimize volatility while holding the same information.6 Under CAPM assumptions, the global market portfolio is the optimal portfolio. Since we know the weights of the global market portfolio and can reasonably estimate the covariance of those assets, we can recover the returns implied by the market.7 This relationship gives rise to the equation for reverse optimization: μ =&nbsp;λ&nbsp;Σ&nbsp;ωmarket Where μ is the return vector, λ is the risk aversion parameter, Σ is the covariance matrix, and ωmarket is the weights of the assets in the global market portfolio.8 By using CAPM, the expected return is essentially determined to be proportional to the asset’s contribution to the overall portfolio risk. It’s called a reverse optimization because the weights are taken as a given and this implies the returns that investors are expecting. While CAPM is an elegant theory, it does rely on a number of limiting assumptions: e.g., a one period model, a frictionless and efficient market, and the assumption that all investors are rational mean-variance optimizers.9 In order to complete the equation above and compute the expected returns using reverse optimization, we need the covariance matrix as an input. Let’s walk through how we arrive at an estimated covariance matrix. The covariance matrix mathematically describes the relationships of every asset with each other as well as the volatility risk of the asset themselves. Our process for estimating the covariance matrix aims to avoid skewed analysis of the conventional historical sample covariance matrix and instead employs Ledoit and Wolf’s shrinkage methodology, which uses a linear combination of a target matrix with the sample covariance to pull the most extreme coefficients toward the center, which helps reduce estimation error.10 Tilting the Betterment Portfolios based on the Fama-French Model Decades of academic research have pointed to certain persistent drivers of returns that the market portfolio doesn’t fully capture.9 A framework known as the Fama-French Model demonstrated how the returns of equity security are driven by three factors: market, value, and size.11 The underlying asset allocation of the Betterment Portfolio Strategy ensures the market factor is incorporated, but to gain higher returns from value and size, we must tilt the portfolios. For the actual mechanism of tilting, we turn to the Black-Litterman model. Black-Litterman starts with our global market portfolio as the asset allocation that an investor should take in the absence of views on the underlying assets. Then, using the Idzorek implementation of Black-Litterman, the Betterment Portfolio Strategy is tilted based on the level of confidence we have for our views on size and value.12 These views are computed from historical data analysis, and our confidence level is a free parameter of the implementation. However, in both cases, the tilts are additionally expressed, taking into account the constraints imposed by the liquidity of the underlying funds. Using Monte Carlo to Add Robustness to Our Tilted Asset Class Weights Despite using reverse optimization to estimate the forward expected returns of our assets, we know that no one can predict the future. Therefore, we use Monte Carlo simulations to predict alternative market scenarios. By doing an optimization of the portfolio strategy under these simulated market scenarios, we can then average the weights of asset classes in each scenario, which leads to a more robust estimate of the optimal weights. This secondary optimization analysis alleviates the portfolio construction’s sensitivity to returns estimates and leads to more diversification and expected performance over a broader range of potential market outcomes. Thus, through our method of portfolio optimization, the Betterment Portfolio Strategy is weighted based on the tilted market portfolio, based on Fama-French, averaged by the weights produced by our Monte Carlo simulations. This highly methodical process gives us a robust portfolio strategy designed to be optimal at any risk level for not just diversification and expected future value, but also ideal for good financial planning and for managing investor behavior. Figure 2. Portfolio Allocations in the Betterment Portfolio Strategy Figure 2. This figure shows the Betterment Portfolio Strategy’s various weighted asset allocations for each stock allocation level. An easy way to see the value-add of our portfolio strategies is to look at the difference between our efficient frontier and that of a so-called “naïve” portfolio, one that is made up of only a U.S. equity index (SPY) and a U.S. bonds index (AGG). The expected returns of Betterment’s portfolio significantly outperform a basic two-fund portfolio for every level of risk. IV. Manage Taxes Using Municipal Bonds For investors with taxable accounts, portfolio returns can be further improved on an after-tax basis by utilizing municipal bonds. This is because the interest from municipal bonds is exempt from federal income tax. To take advantage of this, the Betterment Portfolio Strategy in taxable accounts is tilted toward municipal bonds. Other types of bonds remain for diversification reasons, but the overall bond tax profile is improved. For investors in states with the highest tax rates—New York and California—Betterment can optionally replace the municipal bond allocation with a more narrow set of bonds for that specific state, further saving the investor on state taxes. Betterment customers who live in NY or CA can contact customer support to take advantage of state specific municipal bonds. Conclusion With every element of Betterment’s investing strategy, we hold to the same investment philosophy and the fundamental principles we believe lead to investing success. Our philosophy is simple: We use real-world evidence and systematic decision-making to help increase the value of our customers’ assets. As explained throughout this paper, our portfolio construction process is built on years of research that point to three main areas of focus: diversification through asset allocation, improved value through portfolio optimization, and managing taxes. In the grander scheme of Betterment’s offering, these steps are just the beginning. After setting the strategic weight of assets in the Betterment Portfolio Strategy, the next step in implementing the strategy is Betterment’s investment selection process, which selects the appropriate ETFs for the respective asset exposure in a low-cost, tax-efficient way. In keeping with our philosophy, that process, like the portfolio construction process, is executed in a systematic, rules-based way, taking into account the cost of the fund and the liquidity of the fund. Beyond ticker selection is our established process for allocation management—how we advise downgrading risk over time—and our methodology for automatic asset location, which we call Tax Coordination. Finally, our overlay strategies of automated rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting can be used to help further maximize individualized, after-tax returns. Together these processes put our principles into action, helping each and every Betterment customer maximize value while invested at Betterment and when they take their money home.

      How To Keep Your Financial Data Safe  Cybersecurity threats are now the norm. Here's how we work with customers to protect their financial data. In 10 seconds Your financial information is incredibly valuable. And if you’re like most people, it’s also vulnerable. But by following best practices and using secure apps and services, you can protect your money from digital threats. In 1 minute Cybersecurity threats are bigger and more common than ever. Every investor needs to be on guard. Thankfully, there are plenty of tips and tech to keep your financial data secure. It all starts with you. Trust your instincts Scammers have plenty of tools to steal information. But their most effective tool is often manipulation. Don’t fall for impersonators. If it feels like someone is phishing for your personal information, they probably are. Use encryption Where and how you access your financial accounts is important. Public networks and unsecure apps or sites can easily compromise your information. Encryption adds a level of security. It’s like using a secret code to communicate with a server. Only the server knows the code, and your online activity is unreadable to outside parties.&nbsp; Hide your data with hashing Hashing is similar to encryption, except even the server doesn’t know the secret code. We use hashing to secure your data at Betterment. If there’s information we don’t need to know—like your password—hashing uses an algorithm to turn it into random characters. At Betterment, we only see the random characters. To ensure your password is correct, we just confirm that the random characters are the same as what we have on file. Sync your accounts securely It’s nice to have all your financial information in one place. Usually, that means giving one account access to the others. This makes those other accounts more vulnerable. Thankfully, there’s a better way. At Betterment, we use app-specific passwords to prevent one account from giving access to others. In 5 minutes In this guide, we’ll: Discuss the threats to your financial data Explore your best digital defenses Explain the safest way to sync your financial accounts When it comes to protecting your financial information, the biggest threats are the most obvious: spam calls, phishing emails, and questionable messages. Scammers are constantly developing new, more devious ways to steal your personal information.&nbsp; With software, they guess millions of passwords per second. They scrape your social media accounts for personal information to manipulate you or your friends. But most of all, they’re counting on you to let your guard down. Here are four ways we can work together to protect your financial data. 1. Caution is your first line of defense If a phone call, email, or message seems fishy, it probably is. Would your bank really ask for your account number over the phone? What comes up when you Google the number? The IRS says they don’t email or text message people, and they’ll never ask for your personal information—so is that really them in your inbox? Why does that link have random characters instead of a URL you recognize? Is that the correct spelling of that company’s name? Don’t ever share personal information unless you’re sure who you’re sharing it with. And make sure that other people don’t have access to your passwords or login information, and you’re not reusing passwords on multiple sites. Two-factor authentication helps secure your account using a passcode that rotates over time, or one that you receive via text or a phone call.&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Encryption is essential Any time you access a website or use an app, your device communicates with a server. With the right expertise, someone could hijack these communications and steal your information. Encryption prevents this. Encryption takes these sensitive communications and jumbles them up. The only way to un-jumble them? A key that only your device and the server share. It works like this: When you access Betterment, your connection is encrypted. But if you’re ever visiting a third-party site and don’t see the padlock in the browser bar, your connection is not secure. Don’t share any information on those sites! Bottom line: even if someone snoops on your encrypted activity, they won’t learn anything. 3. Hashing hides your information—even from us! We don’t need to know your password. That’s a secret only you should know. So, we use a technique called “hashing” to let you use it without telling us what it is.&nbsp; Like encryption, hashing uses an algorithm to turn information (like your password) into an unreadable sequence. But unlike encryption, hashing is irreversible. There’s no key to decipher it. We can’t translate the hashing to read your password. However, every time you enter your password, the hashing algorithm produces the same sequence. So we don’t know your password; we just know if it was entered correctly. 4. App-specific passwords let you securely sync accounts Odds are, between all your investments, savings, payment cards, budgeting apps, and financial assets, you use more than one financial institution. That’s OK. But if you’re trying to get a more complete picture of your financial portfolio and see what you have to work with, it helps to have a single, central account that can see the others.&nbsp; Today’s technology makes it easier than ever to sync external accounts. But if you’re not careful, connecting them can make your financial data more vulnerable. To provide a middle ground between complete access and maximum security, Betterment uses app-specific passwords to sync your external accounts.&nbsp; Let’s say you want to sync your Mint account with Betterment, for example. Mint can generate a separate password that gives Betterment read-only access to your Mint account. You’re not sharing your login credentials, and it won’t give you or anyone else the ability to change your Mint account from within Betterment. But you can still see the information you need to make informed decisions about your money. Keep your finances secure At Betterment, we want you to reach your financial goals. It’s a lot easier to do that when you use financial services you can trust. We help secure your financial data through layers of encryption, hashing information we don’t need, and app-specific passwords that reduce your risk.

      What To Expect When You Interview With Betterment  Interviewing can be a long, stressful, and sometimes confusing process. We strive to make the experience as meaningful and enjoyable as possible. Transparency and inclusivity are the heart of everything we do, especially our hiring process. We want every candidate to have access to the information they need and to feel welcomed by everyone they interact with throughout our interview process. If you are interested in working at Betterment, keep reading for an in-depth look at what to expect during the process. For engineering roles, take a look at our Engineering Interviewing with Betterment post for specific details on that process. Finding the best Betterment role for you. The very first step when interviewing with Betterment is finding an open role that fits what you’re looking for in your next career move. The best place to view current openings is the Betterment Careers page. We are constantly updating it as new roles become available. You can also find openings on LinkedIn and Built In NYC. Once you’ve found a role, read through the job description carefully. If it aligns with your skills, experiences, and goals, we encourage you to apply. Because we know the job post is only the beginning of the journey, we aim to include the most relevant information to help you decide if you should apply. For example, we do not include years of experience on our job posts, but instead work to define the exact responsibilities in detail. If you sense that you're capable of what we've outlined, and energized by our job post, you should apply! Don't let a confidence gap get in the way of submitting your application. Join our Talent Community If you do not see the right match for you at this time, don’t worry! We recommend joining our Talent Community. Our hiring needs are always changing and we would be happy to keep you in mind once a role that better aligns with your skills and interests opens in the future. Our hiring process in depth. Once you submit your application, you have officially kicked off the hiring process with us. A member of the Betterment Recruiting team will review it and be in touch. Although you will likely hear back from us sooner, we ask that you give us up to a few weeks to thoroughly review your application given the high volume of applications we receive. If we would like to spend more time with you, the following steps outline the full interview process. While the interview process may vary depending on which role you are applying for, most will look similar to this. Recruiter Interview - A recruiter will reach out to set up time for a phone call to discuss your experiences, skills, and motivations. We will also cover the interview process timeline and compensation expectation details. Hiring Manager Phone Interview - The hiring manager for the role will give you a call to further discuss your background and share in depth details about the role and the team. Round 1 Virtual Interview - This is an opportunity to meet virtually with members of the team you’ll be working closely with Technical Exercise - Across all roles, we may look to evaluate job specific skills in the form of a written exercise or pair programming. We seek to collect a robust set of data points, and find that these exercises can round out what we learn about you from behavioral interviews. If it’s a take home test, you will be given 2-3 days to complete. If not, you will complete this exercise during your scheduled interviews and be instructed on how to prep. Final Round Virtual Interview - This is an opportunity to meet virtually with members of the team, and may include leadership and cross functional stakeholders. Offer - If you make it to this step, that means you thoroughly impressed us and we would be thrilled to have you join us! Please Note: We are conducting all interviews virtually until further notice. The full interview process will take one to two weeks to complete depending on your availability to interview. If you need to expedite the process for any reason, please let your recruiter know so they can work with you to meet your timelines. While we would love to have every candidate reach the offer stage, we often only have one position available. At any stage, if we don’t plan to move forward with your candidacy, you’ll hear from a member of our Recruiting team letting you know. If you need to withdraw from the process, please inform your recruiter at your earliest convenience. We value a fair, inclusive and consistent process. No matter which role you’re interviewing for, you can expect to have the same experience as other candidates who are interviewing for the same role. We run a structured, competency based interview process at Betterment to ensure a fair and inclusive process. Consistency is key to ensure we have the insights we need to make evidence based hiring decisions for every candidate. Furthermore, we're committed to seeing a robust slate of candidates before we make a hiring decision. If you have any timeline constraints, we recommend discussing them with your recruiter. We’re committed to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging. It’s important that our employees reflect the diversity of our customers as we’re building a service that’s for everyone. A diverse internal culture encourages innovation so much more than a homogeneous one. We want each candidate to have a pleasant and welcoming experience at every point of the interview process. It is our goal to have those values of inclusion shine during every candidate interaction. We hope all candidates feel welcomed, valued, and included no matter the outcome of their candidacy. On our applications, you will find a field asking you to share your preferred pronouns. While this section is optional, it is our goal to make sure we are being respectful to all candidates by knowing and addressing them by the pronouns of their choice. We are also dedicated to providing accommodations to candidates with disabilities. If you need accommodations at any point throughout the interview process, please reach out to interview.accommodations@betterment.com.

      Introducing the Innovative Technology Portfolio  If you believe in the power of tech to blaze new trails, you can now tailor your investing to track the companies leading the way. The most valuable companies of today aren’t the same bunch as 20 years ago. With each generation comes new challengers and new categories (Hello, Big Tech). And while we can’t predict the next class of top performers exactly, innovation will likely come from parts of the economy that use technology in new and exciting applications, industries like: semiconductors clean energy virtual reality artificial intelligence nanotechnology This dynamic led us to create and add the Innovative Technology portfolio to our group of low-cost, diversified, and managed portfolios. What is the Innovative Technology Portfolio? The portfolio increases your exposure to companies pioneering the technology mentioned above and more. These innovations carry the potential to reshape the way we work and play, and in the process shape the market’s next generation of high-performing companies. Using the Core portfolio as its foundation, the Innovative Technology portfolio is built to generate long-term returns with a diversified, low-cost approach, but with increased exposure to risk. It contains many of the same investments as Core, but swaps specific exposures to value stocks with an allocation to the SPDR S&amp;P Kensho New Economies Composite ETF (Ticker: KOMP). For a more in-depth look at the portfolio’s methodology, skip over to its disclosure. How are pioneering companies selected? The Kensho index that KOMP tracks uses a special branch of artificial intelligence called Natural Language Processing to screen regulatory data and identify companies helping drive the Fourth Industrial Revolution. After picking companies across 22 categories, each is combined into the overall index and weighted according to their risk and return profiles. Why choose this portfolio over Betterment’s Core portfolio? We built the Innovative Technology portfolio to perform more or less the same as an equivalent stock/bond allocation of the Core portfolio. It may, however, outperform or underperform depending on the return experience of KOMP and the companies this fund tracks. So, if you believe the emerging tech of today will drive the returns of tomorrow—and are willing to take on some additional risk to make that bet— this is a portfolio made with you in mind. Risk and early adoption go hand-in-hand, after all. Why invest in innovation with Betterment? Full disclosure: we’re a little biased when it comes to making bets on new frontiers and the plucky companies exploring them. We may be the largest independent digital investment advisor now, but the category barely existed when we opened shop in 2008. Innovative tech is in our DNA, so when you invest in it with Betterment, you not only get our professional portfolio management tools, you get an advisor with first-hand experience in the field of first movers.

      Betterment Raises $160 Million in Growth Capital  Today, we're announcing that Betterment has secured $160 million in growth capital comprised of a $60 million Series F equity round and a $100 million credit facility. This moment comes as Betterment is the largest independent digital investment advisor with $32 billion in assets under management and nearly 700,000 clients. The Series F round was led by Treasury, with participation from existing investors, including Kinnevik, Bessemer Venture Partners, Francisco Partners, Menlo Ventures, Anthemis Group, Globespan Capital Partners, Citi Ventures, and The Private Shares Fund, as well as new investors Aflac Ventures and ID8 Investments. The financing valued the company at nearly $1.3 billion. The $100 million credit facility was established with ORIX Corporation USA’s Growth Capital group and Runway Growth Capital. ORIX’s Growth Capital group acted as lead arranger and agent. The additional funding will be used to accelerate the record growth Betterment has delivered year-to-date across its core retail investment products and advisor solutions, and particularly its rapidly growing 401(k) offering for small and medium sized businesses. “From day one, Betterment’s mission has been to make people’s lives better with easy-to-use, personalized investment solutions. The record growth and demand for Betterment products and services proves how well we deliver,” said Sarah Levy, Betterment's CEO. “We are thrilled to have the support of new and existing investors who believe in our business model and are excited by the opportunity to support our growth. We’re using these funds to further cement our category leadership with rapid innovation on top of our already differentiated product suite and unique, multi-pronged distribution model that serves retail investors, advisors and small businesses.” “I’ve seen first hand the strength of Betterment’s business model since its founding over a decade ago,” said Eli Broverman, a co-founder of Betterment and a founder of Treasury. “I believe in Betterment’s team and vision, and we are thrilled to support the company’s future success.” To all of our customers, we couldn't have achieved this without you. Thank you!

      Three LGBTQ+ Influencers Share Tips For Successful Financial Planning  LGBTQ individuals and same-sex couples face unique financial challenges when it comes to family planning, healthcare, and more. Here’s how three individuals are preparing for a secure and meaningful financial future. We sat down with three influencers to pull back the curtain on some of the unique factors of LGBTQ+ financial planning, and what that planning, saving, and investing actually looks like. CHRISTOPHER RHODES What’s a financial goal that you’re currently working towards? Or, what’s a financial goal you’re proud of achieving? Saving for top surgery was probably the largest financial goal I've achieved thus far in my life. Top surgery is a huge part of many trans masculine people's lives, and that surgery was incredibly affirming for me and life changing. My insurance did not cover the procedure so I was left with the full amount to cover on my own, which can be quite daunting. What tools and habits helped you reach that goal? I am self-employed and so saving money can be difficult, but the company I run helps trans folks afford gender-affirming surgeries. By the time I was saving money for top surgery we had partnered with five individuals before me to help them reach their financial goals. My brand helped raise about half of the funds I needed for my surgery, and besides that I used my skills to help raise the funds—I did custom art, tattoo designs, and social media work for money. I also was just a lot more conscious about what I was putting away in savings at the time and for what. Nowadays, my biggest goal is saving for the future: Hopefully saving to buy a house, and I do so by having a specific goal and timeline for the amount of savings I have in my account. By dedicating certain paychecks specifically to paying off debt or savings, versus for spending. What would you tell your younger self about money? Money is stressful, and a little bit complicated. I don't think anyone when they're younger quite comprehends how expensive being an adult is. But I think I'd tell myself that it's possible to do what you love and still be able to afford a living— you just have to figure out how to make that work for you, and be responsible and smart about where and how and why you spend your money. Has your identity influenced your relationship with money in any way? Why or why not? I do think that in some aspects my relationship with money is definitely different than it would be if I wasn't trans. The costs of transitioning add up, between doctor's visits, blood work, weekly testosterone injections, surgeries, the legal costs of changing my name and gender marker, not even to mention the costs of family planning one day, etc. I had to account for saving up for things that felt very "adult" starting when I was in my young 20's. ZOE STOLLER What's a financial goal you are currently working towards, or what's one that you've already achieved and are really proud of? I’m officially going to graduate school! I’ve left my 9 to 5 marketing job, and am working more fully as a content creator. I’m saving for graduate school and it’s a lot of work, but I’m confident that I’ll achieve my financial goal. I had known before I decided to enroll that my full time job wasn’t as fulfilling as I wanted it to be, and I recently started making enough money as a content creator to leave. So all the stars aligned, where I was able to leave my job, do content creation full time, and go back to school for my graduate degree. What habits or tools are helping you reach that goal? I’ve gotten very into spreadsheets lately—even though I’m not confident with numbers or money. It’s been a year of transition for me to figure out exactly how to keep meticulous track of my income, my big expenses, and my savings. I’ve been trying to be really proactive, financially. What would you tell your younger self about money? I was very clueless about money, but I have a lot more knowledge now. Growing up, I didn’t understand saving, investing, or general money management. I’d tell my younger self that it’s okay not to know those things, but life is about learning and growing, and going on different journeys. Just because younger me wasn’t very financially aware, doesn’t mean that it’s always going to be that way. And now, I feel much more knowledgeable about money—I’m still learning a lot, but I’m much more confident. Has your identity influenced your relationship with money? Why or why not? As I’ve discovered my lesbian and non-binary identities, I’ve definitely thought about how money will play a role in my future. There are so many more expenses that come with having a family or getting pregnant when you’re LGBTQ. I want a family, but I’ll probably have to do fertility treatments or maybe adoption. There are so many added obstacles that require money when you can’t conceive with a partner, so I’ve been thinking about how to best prepare for that in my future. I want to be able to afford that, should I decide it’s in my future. Anything else you’d like to share with us? Wherever you are in your money and identity journeys, I have full confidence that you will make it through and achieve the goals you’ve set for yourself. GENVIEVE JAFFE What’s a financial goal that you’re currently working towards? Or, what’s a financial goal you’re proud of achieving? My wife and I are hoping to build our dream home next year, in 2022. We want to buy in a community around my home, and we want to be able to put down a lot of money. When we bought our first house, we only put down 10% and had to get a PMI. We’d like to not do that this time, so that’s a big financial goal right now. What tools and habits helped you reach that goal? We have two different investment accounts that we use for the house fund. One is super safe - not risky at all, because we want to be safe if anything should happen. I also have a moderately aggressive portfolio that I don’t manage myself. When COVID hit, it did take a downturn, so it’s important for us to have half in a safer type of investment. In terms of allocating my money, any time I have money coming in from my business, I put some aside into these accounts. My wife and I also have a 529 plan that we put money in for our kids at the end of every year. Additionally, my wife is very on top of our expenses and keeping track of our books. Almost every day she goes into all of our accounts to check balances, check for invoices, and double check our credit cards, student loans, etc. What would you tell your younger self about money? I grew up with working class parents. They traded money for hours, and that’s not a bad thing, but it’s not the way I wanted to live my life. So I actually got a job as a corporate lawyer and was miserable, but had a really great paycheck. I’d always learned that you work until you can retire and live off your 401K, and it wasn’t until I met my wife, who was an entrepreneur, that I realized that’s not how I had to live my life. So I’ve done a lot of mindset work around money, and getting rid of that old school belief that money doesn’t grow on trees. I try to really have a good relationship with money and remember that money is also an exchange of energy. I also just wanted to share that in 2015, I almost had to file for bankruptcy. I was not smart with my money at all. I’d been a corporate lawyer making a very nice, steady paycheck, and when I quit my job, the business that I started actually did very well. But it wasn’t this consistent substantial paycheck I was used to, and I hadn’t changed my habits or my lifestyle. SO I really had to learn quickly to be cognizant of the money that I have, and not rely on the money that I could potentially earn. I did not have to file bankruptcy, thank goodness. But, that fear is something that still lives within me—and now it’s really about being conscious of the money we have and the money we’re spending. Has your identity influenced your relationship with money in any way? Why or why not? We spent $50K+ having our children. I don't say this to freak anyone out but to help prepare you for potential costs that you could incur growing your family as an LGTBQ+ individual / couple / throuple, etc. We had no idea how much money we were about to drop when we started to grow our family. Our path to pregnancy wasn't super straightforward—we ended up doing 3 intrauterine inseminations (IUI), two egg retrievals, and three embryo transfers. Insurance didn't cover in vitro fertilization (IVF), stimulation meds (about $5K), egg retrieval ($11K), or transfer ($3K). We also had to buy sperm (they're about $1,000 per vial), go through tons of testing, and we each had to have surgery. Financially planning for a family is something that I stress people should start early. Seriously, ask for people to contribute to a baby fund for your engagement and wedding. Trust me, no one needs fancy dish-ware. Everyone loves babies and it's an incredible way to make everyone feel part of your journey!

      How We Built 3 New Socially Responsible Investing Portfolios  Betterment is moving the category forward for socially responsible investors by offering three SRI portfolios that are fully diversified and keeps costs low. It makes sense that some investors try to align their investments with the values and social ideals that shape their worldview. The way you live, the career you choose, and the people you care about align with your personal values; shouldn’t your investments do the same? Socially responsible investing (SRI) is an approach to investing that reduces exposure to companies that are deemed to have a negative social impact—e.g., companies that profit from poor labor standards or environmental devastation—while increasing exposure to companies that are deemed to have a positive social impact—e.g., companies that foster inclusive workplaces or commit to environmentally sustainable practices. The Betterment SRI portfolio strategy aims to maintain the diversified, low-fee approach of Betterment’s Core portfolio while increasing investments in companies that meet SRI criteria. Betterment has constructed three SRI portfolios, each with a different focus within the realm of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing. Betterment’s Broad Impact portfolio offers increased exposure to companies that rank highly on all ESG criteria equally, while Betterment’s Climate and Social Impact portfolios focus on increasing exposure to companies with positive impact on a specific subset of ESG criteria. To learn more about how and why we’ve built the Betterment SRI portfolios, read on to the following sections. The technical details of our approach can be found in our full portfolio methodology as well as in our SRI disclosures. Why Did Betterment Develop SRI Portfolios? Betterment is dedicated to offering a personalized experience for our customers. This means providing options that help customers align our advice to their personal values. We decided to develop SRI portfolios because, currently, there are three major ways that investors attempt to execute an SRI strategy, and none meets an investor’s full needs: Some investors buy SRI mutual funds, settling for unreasonably high fees compared to performance and often losing out on important tax and cost optimization opportunities. Others opt for one of several SRI-specific investment managers whose SRI portfolios may fulfill the investors’ desire for SRI screening but do not always provide proper diversification against risk. Still others try to pick their own basket of SRI investments—a challenging, time-intensive, and inaccessible approach for most everyday investors. We set out to do better for SRI investors. You should not have to choose between holding an SRI portfolio and following a low-cost, diversified investment strategy with tax optimization in order to make sure your investments reflect your personal values. The Betterment SRI portfolio strategy is designed to achieve this balance. We allow socially conscious investors to express that preference in their portfolios without sacrificing the aspects of Betterment’s advice that protect their returns the most: proper diversification, tax optimization, and cost control. What Is Betterment’s Approach To SRI? While SRI has been around for decades, especially for institutions like churches and labor unions, the SRI funds available to individual investors have only emerged in the last 20 to 30 years. And most of these SRI products have been actively-managed mutual funds with high fees. Only recently have lower cost options, like ETFs for SRI, emerged in the market. As we developed each of Betterment’s SRI portfolios, we analyzed all low-cost ETFs available which align with the SRI mandate of each portfolio, searching for products that could replace components of our core strategy without disrupting the diversification or cost of the overall portfolio. In each of our SRI portfolios, some bond asset classes are not replaced with an SRI alternative either because an acceptable alternative doesn’t yet exist or because the respective fund’s fees or liquidity levels make for a prohibitively high cost to our customers. Broad Impact Portfolio In 2017, we launched our original SRI portfolio offering, which we’ve been steadily improving over the years. With this release, our original SRI portfolio benefits from a number of additional enhancements, and becomes our “Broad Impact” portfolio, to distinguish it from the new specific focus options, Climate Impact and Social Impact. As we’ve done since 2017, we continue to iterate on our SRI offerings, even if not all the fund products for an ideal portfolio are currently available. Figure 1 shows that we have increased the allocation to funds screened for ESG criteria each year since we launched our initial offering. Today all primary stock ETFs used in our Broad Impact, Climate Impact, and Social Impact portfolios are screened for some ESG criteria. 100% Stock Allocation in the Broad Impact Portfolio Over Time Figure 1. Calculations by Betterment. Portfolios from 2017-2019 represent Betterment’s original SRI portfolio. The 2020 portfolio represents a 100% stock allocation of Betterment’s Broad Impact portfolio. As additional SRI portfolios were introduced in 2020, Betterment’s SRI portfolio became known as the Broad Impact portfolio. As your portfolio allocation shifts to higher bond allocations, the percentage of your portfolio attributable to SRI funds decreases. Additionally, a 100% stock allocation of the Broad Impact portfolio in a taxable goal with Tax Loss Harvesting enabled may not be comprised of all SRI funds because of the lack of suitable secondary and tertiary SRI tickers in the developed and emerging market stock asset classes.&nbsp; Betterment’s Broad Impact portfolio is Betterment’s general ESG investing option. The portfolio seeks to give investors greater exposure to all of the different dimensions of social responsibility, such as lower carbon emissions, ethical labor management, or greater board diversity. By investing in funds that consider all aspects of ESG investing, we create a portfolio that grades well with respect to a number of dimensions that socially responsible investors consider when making investment decisions. When creating the Broad Impact portfolio, the asset classes (i.e., portfolio component) that we can confidently replace with an SRI alternative are: U.S. Stocks Emerging Market Stocks Developed Market Stocks U.S. High Quality Bonds U.S. Investment Grade Corporate Bonds Five asset classes use SRI-specific funds—the rest remain similar to the Betterment Core portfolio—and that difference has an impact on the social responsibility of your overall portfolio. For one, many investors are most concerned about the social responsibility of the largest U.S. companies in their portfolios, which often set standards for acceptable corporate behavior that other companies try to emulate. In our Broad Impact SRI portfolio, stocks of companies deemed to have strong social responsibility practices, such as Microsoft, Google, Proctor &amp; Gamble, Merck, CocaCola, Intel, Cisco, Disney, and IBM may make up a larger portion of the SRI portfolio than they do for Betterment’s Core portfolio. In addition, a major reason why there are no acceptable SRI alternatives for other asset classes is that the demand for these products has not been sufficient to encourage fund managers to create them. By electing to use the Betterment SRI portfolio strategy, you signal to the investing world that there is a demand for high quality SRI investment options and may help to encourage the development of well-diversified, low-cost SRI funds in a wider variety of asset classes. If you’re interested in a more quantitative understanding of how the Broad Impact portfolio compares to our Core portfolio in terms of social responsibility, you can review the SRI ratings published by MSCI, shown below. MSCI’s ratings for the SRI funds used in Betterment’s SRI portfolio are higher than the ratings for the funds used in the Betterment portfolio. For more information on what the numbers mean, read our full whitepaper. MSCI ESG Quality Scores U.S. Stocks Betterment Core Portfolio: 5.94 Betterment Broad Impact Portfolio: 7.31 Emerging Markets Stocks Betterment Core Portfolio: 4.22 Betterment Broad Impact Portfolio: 6.31 Developed Markets Stocks Betterment Core Portfolio: 6.81 Betterment Broad Impact Portfolio: 8.33 US High Quality Bonds Betterment Core Portfolio: 6.13 Betterment Broad Impact Portfolio: 6.91 Sources: MSCI ESG Quality Scores courtesy of etf.com, values accurate as of August 25, 2020 and are subject to change. In order to present the most broadly applicable comparison, scores are with respect to each portfolio’s primary tickers exposure, and exclude any secondary or tertiary tickers that may be purchased in connection with tax loss harvesting. Climate Impact Portfolio Betterment’s Climate Impact portfolio offers investors an SRI portfolio that is more focused on being climate-conscious rather than focused on all ESG dimensions equally like the Broad Impact portfolio. The portfolio achieves this objective by investing in ETFs with a specific focus on mitigating climate change. When compared to the Core portfolio, all of the stock positions have been replaced with more climate-conscious alternatives. Half of the stocks in the portfolio are invested in a global low-carbon stock ETF, which systematically overweights companies with lower carbon emissions, while also underweighting their high-carbon emitting peers. The other half of the stocks in the portfolio are invested in fossil fuel reserve free ETFs. These ETFs replicate broad market indices, while divesting from owners of fossil fuel reserves, defined as crude oil, natural gas, and thermal coal. By investing in the Climate Impact portfolio, investors are actively divesting assets away from holders of fossil fuel reserves while cutting their investments’ carbon emissions. Carbon emissions per dollar of revenue in the 100% stock Climate Impact portfolio are half of those in the 100% stock Betterment Core portfolio, based on weighted average carbon intensity data from MSCI. The other change from the Core portfolio, is that the Climate Impact portfolio replaces our International Developed Bond and US High Quality Bond exposure by investing in a global green bond ETF. Green bonds, as defined per MSCI, fund projects that support alternative energy, energy efficiency, pollution prevention and control, sustainable water, green building, and climate adaptation. Social Impact Portfolio Betterment’s Social Impact portfolio offers investors an SRI portfolio that is more focused on supporting social equity and minority empowerment compared to the Broad Impact portfolio. The portfolio achieves this objective by augmenting the ESG exposure achieved in the Broad Impact portfolio with two additional ETFs each with a unique focus on diversity, NACP and SHE. NACP is a U.S. stock ETF offered by Impact Shares that tracks the Morningstar Minority Empowerment Index. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has developed a methodology for scoring companies based on a number of minority empowerment criteria. These scores are used to create the Morningstar Minority Empowerment Index, an index which seeks to maximize the minority empowerment score while maintaining market-like risk and strong diversification. The end result is an index which provides greater exposure to US companies with strong diversity policies that empower employees irrespective of race or nationality. By investing in NACP, investors are allocating more of their money to companies with a better track record of social equity as defined by the NAACP. SHE is a US Stock ETF that allows investors to invest in more female-led companies compared to the broader market. In order to achieve this objective, companies are ranked within each sector according to their ratio of women in senior leadership positions. Only companies that rank highly within each sector are eligible for inclusion in the fund. By investing in SHE, investors are allocating more of their money to companies that have demonstrated greater gender diversity within senior leadership than other firms in their sector. Let’s Make Investing More Socially Responsible As you review our SRI portfolios, you might ask yourself, “Is it more important that my portfolio is well-diversified with reasonable costs, or should my money be exclusively invested in SRI funds, regardless of the cost or level of diversification?” These are insightful questions that get at the heart of the tradeoffs involved in socially responsible investing today. Currently, most accessible SRI approaches make investors choose between a well-diversified, low-cost portfolio and an inadequately diversified and/or higher cost portfolio comprised of SRI funds. Diversification and controlled costs are investing fundamentals that all investors—SRI or not—deserve. They’re principles that live at the heart of fiduciary advice. The only reason other SRI solutions settle for higher costs and less diversification is because the industry isn’t challenged to offer something better. We at Betterment believe we can create a future that does not ask SRI investors to choose. We are committed to achieving more socially responsible investing through our research over time and are tracking the availability of better vehicles for these purposes. Since originally launching the legacySRI portfolio in 2017 (and now the Broad Impact portfolio) with ESG exposure to only U.S. large cap stocks, we’ve been able to expand the exposure to now cover also developed market stocks, emerging market stocks, and US high quality bonds. We’ve also been able to launch the Climate and Social Impact portfolios which add exposure to focused ESG issues by allocating to assets such as green bonds or gender-diverse U.S. Stocks. As always, we will continue to monitor additional ways to improve our portfolios. In the future, we will improve our SRI portfolio even further, iterating and adding new SRI funds that satisfy our cost and diversification requirements as they become available. Get started with the Betterment SRI Portfolio. Get started with our approach to SRI today, and join us as we work to expand our SRI approach together. If you don’t yet have a Betterment account, open an account to explore the portfolio options available to you. If you already have a Betterment account, you can enable a SRI portfolio when adding a new goal or by updating your existing goal’s portfolio strategy via the “Portfolio Analysis” tab of your Betterment account. Once on your “Portfolio Analysis” tab, you will see an “edit” option under the “Portfolio Strategy” section. Once you select “edit” you will be sent to the “Portfolio Strategy” flow where you can opt into a SRI portfolio.

      ETF Selection For Portfolio Construction: A Methodology  Betterment seeks to maximize investor take-home returns, which drives our criteria and process for selecting ETFs (the funds in your portfolio). TABLE OF CONTENTS Why ETFs ETF Selection Total Annual Cost of Ownership Mitigating Market Impact Conclusion One of Betterment’s central objectives is to help investors achieve the best possible take-home returns. At the most fundamental level, we do this through the allocation advice we provide for every portfolio. However, another key component of performance is the investment vehicles we use in our portfolio. They are an essential—but often overlooked—element in maximizing the risk-adjusted, after-tax, net-of-costs return for our customers. In the following piece, we detail Betterment’s investment selection methodology, including: Why we use exchange-traded funds (ETFs) Why expense ratios are not the whole story How Betterment estimates an investment vehicle’s total annual cost of ownership (TACO). Why Do We Invest in ETFs? An ETF is a security that generally tracks a broad-market stock or bond index or a basket of assets just like an index mutual fund, but trades just like a stock on a listed exchange. By design, index ETFs closely track their benchmarks—such as the S&amp;P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average—and are bought and sold like stocks throughout the day. Betterment only uses open-ended ETFs (which carry no restrictions around issuing or redeeming shares) as they have many embedded structural advantages when compared to mutual funds. These include: Clear Goals and Mandates Unlike many actively managed mutual funds, the ETFs we use have definite mandates to passively track broad-market benchmark indexes. A passive mandate explicitly restricts the fund administrator to the singular goal of replicating a benchmark rather than making active investment decisions constituting market timing, building concentration in either a single name, group of names, or themes in an effort to beat the fund’s underlying benchmark. Adherence to this mandate ensures the same level of investment diversification as the benchmark indexes, makes performance more predictable, and reduces idiosyncratic risk associated with active manager decisions. Intraday Availability ETFs are transactable during all open market hours just like any other stock. As such, they are heavily traded by the full spectrum of equity market participants including market makers, short-term traders, buy-and-hold investors, and fund administrators themselves creating and redeeming units as needed (or increasing or decreasing the supply of ETFs based on market demand). This diverse trading activity leads to most ETFs carrying low liquidity premiums (or lower costs to transact due to competition from readily available market participants pushing prices downward) and equity-like transaction times irrespective of the underlying holdings of each fund. This generally makes ETFs fairly liquid, which makes them cheaper and easier to trade on-demand for activities like creating a new portfolio or rebalancing an existing one. In comparison, mutual funds transact only once per day, which introduces significant lag between desired and filled price. Moreover, certain portfolio management strategies like tax loss harvesting require liquid securities that trade more than once a day. Low and Unbiased Fee Structures Below&nbsp;is the expense ratio for the 70% stock Betterment IRA portfolio in 50% primary and 50% secondary tickers and the asset-weighted average expense ratio for all ETFs. Expense Ratio Comparison The chart above compares the asset-weighted expense ratios of the Betterment Portfolio Strategy versus the average ETF, based on data collected by the Investment Company Institute in their 2018 Factbook. The range for average expense ratios of Betterment’s recommended portfolios at the time of this 2018 comparison was 0.07% to 0.15%, depending on allocation. Note that the range is subject to change depending on current fund prices. Because most benchmarks update constituents (i.e., the specific stocks and related weights that make up a broad-market index) fairly infrequently, passive index-tracking ETFs also register lower annual turnover (or the rate a fund tends to transact its holdings) and thus fewer associated costs passed through to investors. In addition, ETFs are generally managed by their administrators as a single share class that holds all assets as a single entity. This structure naturally lends itself as a defense against administrators practicing fee discrimination across the spectrum of available investors. As an example, some index-tracking mutual fund administrators segment their funds into several share classes where institutional and high net-worth investors can secure lower fees and more lenient terms in exchange for investing a higher amount upfront. Retail investors with lower available investment balances are funneled into higher fee share classes with more stringent terms. By comparison, with only one share class, ETFs are investor-type agnostic. The result is that ETF administrators provide the same exposures and low fees to the entire spectrum of potential buyers. The fund and administration structure of ETFs also eliminates concerns stemming from potential conflict of interest in the standard sales and access channels utilized by mutual funds. While mutual funds can be sold directly to investors by their administrators, most investments in mutual funds are recommended and placed through a multi-tiered sales and distribution network. Each layer of the network tacks on a host of opaquely documented fees. These fee amounts are entirely non-standard across funds and networks, and are largely the result of negotiations between marketing and sales executives who are divorced from the investment functions of the fund administrators. These network fees come in the form of front and back loaded costs, or immediate one-time fees assessed for initial investment or redemptions. Sales channels are subject to compensation incentives that tend to favor investment recommendations that yield allocation to funds where they can collect more fees over selections that might ultimately be in the best interest of their clients. Tax Efficiency In the case when a fund (irrespective of its specific structure) sells holdings that have experienced capital appreciation, the capital gains generated from those sales must, by law, be accrued and distributed to shareholders by year-end in the form of distributions. These distributions increase tax liabilities for all of the fund’s shareholders. With respect to these distributions, ETFs offer a significant tax advantage for shareholders over mutual funds. Because mutual funds are not exchange traded, the only available counterparty available for a buyer or seller is the fund administrator. When a shareholder in a mutual fund wishes to liquidate their holdings in the fund, the fund’s administrator must sell securities in order to generate the cash required to satisfy the redemption request. These redemption-driven sales generate capital gains that lead to distributions for not just the redeeming investor, but all shareholders in the fund. Mutual funds thus effectively socialize the fund’s tax liability to all shareholders, leading to passive, long-term investors having to help pay a tax bill for all intermediate (and potentially short-term) shareholder transactions. Because ETFs are exchange traded, the entire market serves as potential counterparties to a buyer or seller. When a shareholder in an ETF wishes to liquidate their holdings in the fund, they simply sell their shares to another investor just like that of a single company’s equity shares. The resulting transaction would only generate a capital gain or loss for the seller and not all investors in the fund. Mutual fund distributions are generally decided by the fund administrator and can introduce material variability in an investor’s tax profile. ETF tax profiles are fairly static with most of the tax realization/deferral control being held by the individual investor. In addition, ETFs enjoy a slight advantage when it comes to taxation on dividends paid out to investors. After the passing of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, certain qualified dividend payments from corporations to investors are only subject to the lower long-term capital gains tax rather than standard income tax (which is still in force for ordinary, non-qualified dividends). Qualified dividends have to be paid by a domestic corporation (or foreign corporation listed on a domestic stock exchange) and must be held by both the investor and the fund for 61 of the 120 days surrounding the dividend payout date. As a result of active mutual funds’ higher turnover, a higher percentage of dividends paid out to their investors violate the holding period requirement and increase investor tax profiles. Investment Flexibility The maturation and growth of the global ETF market over the last two decades has led to the development of an immense spectrum of products covering different asset classes, markets, styles, and geographies. The result is a robust market of potential portfolio components which are versatile, extremely liquid, and easily substitutable. ETFs Have Seen Significant Growth &nbsp; Source: Investment Company Institute 2016 Investment Company Fact Book, Chapter 3: Exchange-Traded Funds, Figure 3.2 Selecting Across the ETF Universe Despite all the advantages of ETFs, it is still important to note that not all ETFs are exactly alike or equally beneficial to an investor. The primary task of Betterment’s investment selection process is to pick the set of funds or vehicles that provide exposure to the desired asset classes with the least amount of difference between underlying asset class behavior and portfolio performance. In other words, we attempt to minimize the “frictions” (the collection of systematic and idiosyncratic factors that lead to performance deviations) between ETFs and their benchmarks. The principal component of frictions between tracked asset classes and investor returns is the fund’s expense ratio: The higher the expenses charged to the investor, the lower the resulting returns that pass through. However, relying on just expense ratio to make an instrument selection could yield to a less efficient portfolio. There are other material frictions that factor in that Betterment also considers, discussed below. Betterment’s measure of these frictions is summarized as the total annual cost of ownership, or TACO: a composition of all relevant frictions used to rank and select ETF candidates for the Betterment portfolio. Total Annual Cost of Ownership The total annual cost of ownership (TACO) is Betterment’s fund scoring method, used to rate funds for inclusion in the Betterment portfolio. TACO takes into account an ETF’s transactional and liquidity costs as well as costs associated with holding funds. TACO is determined by two components, or frictions as mentioned above, and they are a fund’s cost-to-trade and cost-to-hold. The first, cost-to-trade, represents the cost associated with trading in and out of funds during the course of regular investing activities, such as rebalancing, cash inflows or withdrawals, and tax loss harvesting. Cost-to-trade is generally influenced by two factors: Volume: A measure of how many shares change hands each day. Bid-ask spread: The difference between the price at which you can buy a security and the price at which you can sell the same security at any given time. The second component, cost-to-hold, represents the annual costs associated with owning the fund and is generally influenced by these two factors: Expense ratios: Fund expenses imposed by an ETF administrator. Tracking difference: The deviation in performance from the fund’s benchmark index. Let’s review the specific inputs to each component in more detail: Cost-to-Trade: Volume and Bid-Ask Spread Volume Volume is a historical measure of how many shares may change hands each day. This helps assess how easy it might be to find a buyer or seller in the future. This is important because it tends to indicate the availability of counterparties to buy (e.g., when Betterment is selling ETFs) and sell (e.g., when Betterment is buying ETFs). The more shares of an ETF Betterment needs to buy on behalf of our customers, the more volume is needed to complete the trades without impacting market prices. As such, we measure average market volume for each ETF as a percentage of Betterment’s normal trading activity. Funds with low average daily trading volume compared to Betterment’s trading volume will have a higher cost, because Betterment’s higher trading volume is more likely to influence market prices. Bid-Ask Spread Generally market transactions are associated with two prices: the price at which people are willing to sell a security, and the price others are willing to pay to buy it. The difference between these two numbers is known as the bid-ask spread, and can be expressed in currency or percentage terms. For example, a trader may be happy to sell a share at $100.02, but only wishes to buy it at $99.98. The bid-ask currency spread here is $.04, which coincidentally also represents a bid-ask percentage of 0.04%. In this example, if you were to buy a share, and immediately sell it, you’d end up with 0.04% less due to the spread. This is how traders and market makers make money—by providing liquid access to markets for small margins. Generally, heavily traded securities with more competitive counterparties willing to transact will carry lower bid-ask spreads. Unlike the expense ratio, the degree to which you care about bid-ask spread likely depends on how actively you trade. Buy-and-hold investors typically care about it less compared to active traders, because they will accrue significantly fewer transactions over their intended investment horizons. Minimizing these costs is beneficial to building an efficient portfolio which is why Betterment attempts to select ETFs with narrower bid-ask spreads. Cost-to-Hold: Expense Ratio and Tracking Difference Expense Ratio An expense ratio is the set percentage of the price of a single share paid by shareholders to the fund administrators every year. ETFs often collect these fees from the dividends passed through from the underlying assets to holders of the security, which result in lower total returns to shareholders. Since expenses are a principal component in reducing investor returns, ETFs with higher expenses generally tend to perform worse. For context, a Betterment 70% equity tax-advantaged portfolio contains ETFs with expense ratios that average to 0.11%. Tracking Difference Tracking difference is the underperformance or outperformance of a fund relative to the benchmark index it seeks to track. Funds may deviate from their benchmark indexes for a number of reasons, including any trades with respect to the fund’s holdings, deviations in weights between fund holdings and the benchmark index, and rebates from securities lending. It’s important to note that, over any given period, tracking difference isn’t necessarily negative; in some periods, it could lead to outperformance. However, tracking difference can introduce systematic deviation in the long-term returns of the overall portfolio when compared purely with a comparable basket of benchmark indexes other than ETFs. Finding TACO We calculate TACO as the sum of the above components: TACO = "Cost-to-Trade" + "Cost-to-Hold" As mentioned above, cost-to-trade estimates the costs associated with buying and selling funds in the open market. This amount is weighted to appropriately represent the aggregate investing activities of the average Betterment customer in terms of cash flows, rebalances, and tax loss harvests. The cost-to-hold represents our expectations of the annual costs an investor will incur from owning a fund. Expense ratio makes up the majority of this cost, as it is the most explicit and often the largest cost associated with holding a fund. We also account for tracking difference between the fund and its benchmark index. In many cases, cost-to-hold, which includes an ETF’s expense ratio, will be the dominant factor in the total cost calculations. Of course, one can’t hold a security without first purchasing it, so we must also account for transaction costs, which we accomplish with our cost-to-trade component. Minimizing Market Impact Market impact, or the change in price caused by an investor buying or selling a fund, is incorporated into Betterment’s total cost number through the cost-to-trade component. This is specifically through the interaction of bid-ask spreads and volume. However, we take additional considerations to control for market impact when evaluating our universe of investable funds. A key factor in Betterment’s decision-making is whether the ETF has relatively high levels of existing assets under management and average daily traded volumes. This helps to ensure that Betterment’s trading activity and holdings will not dominate the security’s natural market efficiency, which could either drive the price of the ETF up or down when trading. We define market impact for any given investment vehicle as the Betterment platform’s relative size (RSRS) in two key areas. Our share of the fund’s assets under managements is calculated quite simply as RS of AUM = ('AUM of Betterment' / 'AUM of ETF') while our share of the fund’s daily traded volume is calculated as RS Vol = ('Vol of Betterment' / 'Vol of ETF') Minimizing investor frictions is one of the core goals of the Betterment investment methodology. ETFs without an appropriate level of assets or daily trade volume might lead to a situation where Betterment’s activity on behalf of customers moves the existing market in the security. In an attempt to avoid potentially negative effects upon our investors, we do not consider ETFs with smaller asset bases and limited trading activity. Any market impact measure that does not satisfy our criteria disqualifies the security from consideration.

Last updated May, 2021. Conclusion We are constantly monitoring our investment choices. Our selection analysis is run quarterly to assess the following: validity of existing selections, potential changes by fund administrators (raising or lowering expense ratios), and changes in specific ETF market factors (including tighter bid-ask spreads, lower tracking differences, growing asset bases, or reduced selection-driven market impact). We also consider the tax implications of portfolio selection changes and estimate the net benefit of transitioning between investment vehicles for our customers. The power of this methodology is how quickly it arrives at a total cost figure that synthesizes several dissimilar factors across many different candidate securities. The ability to quickly assess candidate suitability across the wider universe of potential options for each asset class is novel and incredibly useful in fulfilling our objectives of constantly providing a robust investment product, platform, advice, performance, and process control. We will continue to drive innovation when trying to improve investor take-home returns by finding ways to lower costs and frequently re-evaluating our portfolio choices. We use the ETFs that result from this process in our allocation advice that is based on your investment horizon, balance, and goal. ETFs are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. The value of the portfolio will fluctuate with the value of the underlying securities. ETFs may trade for less than their net asset value (NAV). There is always a risk that an ETF will not meet its stated objective on any given trading day.

      How Memestocks Affected Investors’ Actions And Emotions  In April, Betterment surveyed 1,500 investors to examine “the rise of the day trader,” and how ‘memestocks’ affected their actions and emotions when it comes to making financial decisions. Money and emotions have long gone hand-in-hand, and this is no more apparent than during significant financial crises. From the 2008 market crash to COVID-19’s economic impact, we’ve seen first hand how money has the ability to impact our stress levels, mental health and personal relationships. And yet in times of particular financial strife—or likely because of it— many people take actions with their money that often undermine their emotional wellbeing, sacrificing long-term happiness for short-term pleasure without even realizing it at the time. This trend toward short-termism grew in 2020: people stuck inside, on screens all day and kept from their normal activities sought new ways to fill their time and energy. Many took up day trading, culminating in one of the wildest rides at the beginning of 2021 (and recent surges demonstrating people are still trying to head to the moon) with Gamestop, AMC, Blackberry and other retail stocks caught in the middle of a clash between amateur retail and institutional investors. Following this eventful start to the year, Betterment was curious to see both the immediate and long-term impact this had on investors, particularly those involved in the action. In this report -- a survey of 1,500 active investors conducted by a third party -- we took a look at the rise of day trading activity and the impact it did (or didn’t have) on people’s behavior. From their own forecasts, it looks like “the rise of the day trader” is here to stay -- but forecasting is hard. None of us would have bet on the pandemic and the changes it's causing. People actually aren't very good at forecasting their own preferences and behavior in the future, so it will be interesting to see if said forecasts actually come to fruition. Regardless, at Betterment we welcome the addition of consumers looking to learn more about the markets and, ultimately, how to balance their portfolios for the long-term too. Section One: The Rise Of Day Trading Activity With movie theaters, stadiums, bars and restaurants closed, many people took up day trading during the COVID-19 pandemic. Half of our total respondents said they actively day trade investments, and nearly half of those day-traders (49%) have been doing it for 2 years or less. While most day traders indicated their main reason for doing so was that they believed they could make more money in a shorter period of time (58%), many (43%) also indicated it was because it is fun and entertaining. Of those who look to day trading for fun/entertainment, half (52%) said it was to make up for the bulk of their other hobbies—like sports, live music, social gatherings, gambling—not being available due to COVID-19. And these day traders have fully acknowledge that COVID-19 played a big impact role in their market activity overall: 54% indicated they trade more often as a result of COVID-19; and interestingly, 58% said they expect to day trade more as normal activities return and COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, likely as a result of what they learned during this downtime. Only 12% said they expect to trade less. More than half (58%) are using less than 30% of their portfolio to actively trade individual securities or stocks. Nearly two thirds also allow an advisor (either online or in-person) to manage a separate part of their portfolio. Betterment's Point Of View: It is interesting to see more respondents expect to day trade more after the pandemic than are currently day trading: we imagine it is hard for people to forecast themselves into the future and imagine doing things differently than they are now. However, what is positive to see is these people aren’t using an excessive amount of their portfolio to day trade. The majority of investors day trade with a minority of their total investing balance, and delegate day-to-day management of the larger portion of their portfolio to an advisor. Passing hobby or not, how educated is the average day trader on what they’re buying and what they stand to gain—or lose? Sixty one percent rely on financial news websites to decide which stocks to buy, but nearly half (42%) are influenced by social media accounts, showing just how powerful “memestocks” can be. Betterment's Point Of View: More than half of the respondents suggested they buy stocks based on company names they’re familiar with, but we’ve seen this lead to issues in the past—with “ticker mis-matches,” where people trade the ticker of a stock that isn't the correct company. For example, after a tweet from Elon Musk about Signal (a non-profit messaging app), a different company’s stock was sent soaring 3,092%. We also asked day trader respondents if they consider capital gains taxes when deciding to sell their investments. While the majority (60%) indicated that it influences them to hold onto stocks longer to avoid short-term capital gains, 14% said they weren’t aware there was a difference in taxes based on how long they hold a stock. Another 17% said they simply don’t care about the short-term capital gains tax. Who invested their stimmys? Almost all (91%) respondents received some stimulus money, and nearly half (46%) invested some of that money; of those who did invest it, 70% invested half or less of their stimulus. Day trader and male respondents were more likely to invest then their counterparts, as represented in the graphic below. This is in contrast to our COVID-19 investor sentiment survey from 2020, where only 9% of respondents indicated they put some of their stimulus money towards investment. Last year’s response pool was primarily focused on building out their emergency funds, with 40% putting money into a safety net. This is a good indication that respondents are more comfortable with their financial situations this year, compared to the throes of the pandemic. Section Two: Memestocks Understanding And Involvement We asked all respondents how well they understood what occurred in the stock market in January &amp; February surrounding “memestocks” like GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry and other retail investments. Most indicated having some level of understanding, but nearly a quarter (24%) of all respondents said they didn’t understand it well at all; and only half (51%) of day trader respondents said they understood what happened very well. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of all survey respondents said they did not actively purchase any popular retail investments (GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, etc.) during the stock market rally in January or February. But those that DID were primarily day traders. Of all respondents that did buy in actively, 55% are still holding onto all their investments. Only 2% of those that sold these investments sold everything at a loss; 44% sold all for a profit and 54% sold some at a profit and some at a loss. Of those that bought into memestocks, there is a near universal consensus that they will continue investing in stocks like these that get a lot of attention in the future—97% said they’re at least somewhat likely to invest. Betterment's Point Of View: It is interesting to see the majority of respondents holding onto their investments - are they expecting another high or holding on because they don't want to admit they made a bad investment? Disposition Effect says people tend to hold on until they get back to zero loss; but seeing so few sell entirely for a loss is encouraging. However, 60% previously said thinking of short-term capital gains taxes encourages them to hold onto their investments longer, which is good to see. Section Three: Money And Stress Factors It’s no secret that money and stress are linked, so we wanted to take a look at respondents’ money habits and how that may be impacting stress levels. The consensus is that for better and for worse day traders and younger generations are more engaged with their finances. We asked respondents how much they stress about their finances on a daily basis—three quarters said they stress to some degree. Interestingly, when we looked a layer deeper, day traders are much more stressed than non-day trader—86% indicated they stress to some degree, vs 65% of their counterparts. Unsurprisingly, younger generations are more stressed about their finances than older ones. In looking at the causes of the stress: respondents are nearly equally concerned about money in the short term, near term future, and long term future with the top 3 financial stress factors being their daily expenses (43%), how much money they will have in retirement (43%), and how much money they have saved (42%). We asked respondents how often they are checking their bank account and investment portfolio balances -&nbsp; 39% are looking at their bank account balances every day, with 11% of those checking multiple times a day; 37% also check their investment portfolio balances every day, with 16% of those checking multiple times a day. When we look a layer deeper, we find that day traders are checking both their bank account and investment portfolio balances significantly more than non-day traders. Interesting Bank Account Habits 50% of day traders indicated they check at least once a day (18% multiple times) vs 29% of non-daytraders (5% multiple times). Men check their accounts more often—41% at least once a day (13% multiple times) vs 36% of women (8% multiple times). 46% of Gen Z/Millennials and Gen X both said they check their accounts at least once a day, whereas only 28% of Boomers said the same. Those making more money actually check their accounts more often—42% respondents making $100K or more check every day, compared to 39% of those making between $50-100K and 35% of those making less than $50K. Interesting Investment Account Habits Unsurprisingly, 56% of day traders said they check their investment portfolio balances every day (25% multiple times a day), whereas only 18% of non-day traders said the same. 41% of men check every day, compared to 30% of women. 47% of Gen Z/Millennials check every day, compared to 41% of Gen X and 22% of Boomers. 42% of those making 100K or more check every day, compared to 35% making between $50-100K and 30% of those making less than $50K. Betterment's Point Of View: The differences between men and women here are in line with research we’ve seen elsewhere. Women are less focused on market performance, and more focused on the end financial outcome. They also tend to invest at lower risk levels, so are less likely to see extreme ups and downs. Additionally, Women tend to be less competitive/score based in general, so are less interested in monitoring the game. Encouragingly, when we asked people how they felt checking these accounts, the positive responses outweighed negative options for both. Interestingly, day traders were significantly more excited for both (21% for bank accounts, 25% for investments) than non-day traders (4% and 12%, respectively) as well. Most respondents (89%) indicated they’re putting some money away every month, but it's equally split as to where that money is actually going. Conclusion At Betterment, we have often compared day trading to going to Vegas—have a great time, enjoy yourself, but be prepared to come back home with fewer dollars in your wallet and a hangover.&nbsp; The trends outlined in this report seem to indicate that more people are dipping their toe into the investing pool and (so far) few have decided to walk away. Whether this trend will continue—and the long term impact it will have on people’s finances, health, stress, etc.—remains to be seen. And for those who want to avoid the FOMO of the next big memestock, but aren’t sure of the best way to get started—a simple alternative is investing in a well diversified portfolio. That way, whenever someone asks if you own the hottest thing, you can say “yes”, regardless of what it is. Methodology An online survey was conducted with a panel of potential respondents from April 26, 2021 to May 3, 2021. The survey was completed by a total of 1,500 respondents who are 18 years and older and have any kind of investment (excluded if only 401k). Of the 1,500 respondents, 750 of them actively day traded their investments while the other 750 did not. The sample was provided by Market Cube, a research panel company. All respondents were invited to take the survey via an email invitation. Panel respondents were incentivized to participate via the panel’s established points program, regardless of positive or negative feedback. Participants were not required to be Betterment clients to participate.

      How Much Could You Be Losing To Fees?  Unexpected or hidden fees can damage your long-term investment returns. Sync your outside accounts with Betterment now and see how much you’re being charged by other investment providers. When you invest in valuable items, it’s easy to overlook the hidden fees. Buying a house certainly requires property tax and insurance payments, but you may quickly discover hidden fees in your investment—such as home repair and maintenance costs—of which you were never aware nor did you expect. Purchasing a car results in a similar scenario, in that taxes and insurance are rarely the only expenses. Repair, cleaning, maintenance, and miscellaneous fees can catch you off guard. You’ll soon realize that it’s more expensive than you ever thought to manage these assets. The same is true with investment accounts. At Betterment, we think all investment accounts should be clearly and transparently priced, without any hidden fees. Now, we can help you discover if you’re paying high advisory or hidden fund fees across all of your investments. Here’s a deeper dive into the types of fees you may encounter in your investments with outside fund providers. Understanding Fund Fees Expense Ratios When investing in any mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF), the investor pays fees that cover the management, administration, and operations of the fund. These fees are summarized in the expense ratio. This fee may also include marketing costs which go to the salesperson, known as 12b-1 fees. The expense ratio is visible in the fund’s prospectus, but in general people rarely read that long document. It often goes unnoticed because the fee is not explicitly charged from the balance, but is instead built into the fund’s daily pricing. Contrary to general assumptions, paying higher expense ratios does not guarantee higher returns in an investment portfolio. Since paying higher fees does not necessarily equal high returns, choosing funds with a lower expense ratio is a simple yet generally sound investment strategy. Advisory Fees If you hire an advisor to choose and manage your investments, including one such as Betterment, you’ll most likely pay for the service received. This is known as an “advisory fee.” If you pay advisory fees with an outside investment provider, you can include the fees after you sync your outside accounts with Betterment. We then summarize how much you are paying in fees per year, and also take that number into account when providing retirement advice. Some advisors do not charge fees in an overly transparent manner but earn revenues in other ways. This can include the 12b-1 fees mentioned above, which are built into the expense ratio of the fund, or through load charges, explained below. Lesser-Known Fees Aside from expense ratios and advisory fees, some investment funds have even less transparent costs. One reason Betterment chooses ETFs for our portfolios is because they do not contain the fees mentioned below1, and they are often tax-efficient. On the other hand, mutual funds can have additional fees and revenue-sharing relationships, due to the level of trading and activity involved with the fund’s management. When investing in mutual funds, they typically have the following costs which are borne of the investor, but not included in the expense ratio. These include: Sales load fee: A sales charge imposed by “Class A” or “Class B” mutual funds when you purchase shares. “Class C” shares can have a load fee when you withdraw your money from the fund. These loads are commissions that pay the professional adviser or broker who sold you the fund. Trading fee: Trading fees when you buy or sell stocks in a brokerage account, or when the manager of a mutual fund pays to make trades within the fund. These expenses are taken out of the daily pricing of the fund, but not included in the expense ratio. These fees are hard to estimate, but in general a fund that has a high turnover, like an actively managed fund, will have higher trading fees. Redemption fee: Also referred to as a “market-timing fee,” or “short-term trading fee,” mutual funds charge this fee to discourage investors from making short-term “round trip” transactions (i.e., a purchase, typically a transfer, followed by a sale within a short period of time). 4 Steps to Minimize Investment Fees As a smart investor, there are four steps you can take to help minimize your investment fees. Know where you stand. Look up the expense ratios for all of your investments, or simply sync your outside accounts with Betterment to see a summary of the total advisory and fund expenses you are currently paying. Choose low cost funds. Typically, index ETFs are cheaper than mutual fund equivalents. They generally have no loads or marketing expenses. They also have lower turnover, which means lower internal trading costs and low taxes. Avoid trading costs. If you envision lots of trading activity across your investments, try choosing a platform that has no trading costs. Trading costs can be a constant drag on returns, especially when you use smart strategies like rebalancing and tax loss harvesting. Betterment includes both smart rebalancing and Tax Loss Harvesting+ (TLH+) benefits at no additional cost for customers. Select a low cost advisor. If you have investments with other providers, inquire regarding what fees outside of expense ratios are being charged. You can then enter these additional fees to appear on your synced non-Betterment accounts. Betterment is the largest independent online financial advisor, and we also deliver enhanced value with transparent pricing and lower fees than traditional financial services. When you sync your accounts, not only can you see all of your wealth in one place—we’ll also help you discover which outside investments are charging you high fees so that you can take action accordingly.

      How Much Crypto Should I Own?  What’s the right amount to keep in a portfolio? If investors want to dip their toes into crypto, we recommend aiming for this allocation. Many of us have followed the dramatic rises and precipitous falls of bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general, over the past few years. Some may have written them off entirely after 80% declines in 2018, only to see them roar back into investors’ collective consciousness in 2020. Certainly sentiment has shifted over a short two years—more institutional investors are taking a hard look at crypto and previous naysayers have softened their view. This all leads to one question: How much cryptocurrency should I own? Math to the rescue. It goes without saying that this is a hard question to answer. But, we can borrow a page from modern quantitative finance to help us arrive at a potential answer. For years, Wall Street “quants” have used a mathematical framework to manage their portfolios called the Black-Litterman model. Yes, the “Black” here is the same one from the famous Black-Scholes options pricing formula, Fischer Black. And “Litterman” is Robert Litterman, a long-time Goldman Sachs quant. Without getting into too much detail, the model starts with a neutral, “equilibrium” portfolio and provides a mathematical formula for increasing your holdings based on your view of the world. What’s amazing is that it incorporates not just your estimate about how an investment might grow, but also your confidence in that estimate, and translates those inputs into a specific portfolio allocation. Your starting point: 0.50% The Black-Litterman model uses the global market portfolio—all the asset holdings in the world—as its starting point for building a portfolio. This means that, if you don’t have any other views on what investments might perform better or worse, this is the portfolio you should consider holding. In early 2021, the global market for stocks totaled $95 trillion and the global bonds market reached $105 trillion. The cryptocurrency market as a whole was valued at roughly $1 trillion. This means that cryptocurrency represents 0.50% of the global market portfolio. The Global Market Portfolio In Early 2021 Source: Betterment sourced the above cryptocurrency data and stock and bond data from third parties to produce this visualization.&nbsp; Just as there are plenty of arguments to hold more cryptocurrency, there are also many arguments to hold less. However, from the model’s standpoint, 0.50% should be your starting allocation. Now, add your views. This is where the mathematical magic comes into play. For any given growth rate in cryptocurrency (or any investment for that matter), the Black-Litterman model will return the amount you should hold in your portfolio. What’s more, you can specify your level of conviction in that assumed growth rate and the model will adjust accordingly. In the below chart are the portfolio allocations to bitcoin derived from the Black-Litterman model. This chart can serve as a useful, hypothetical guideline when thinking about how much cryptocurrency you might want to hold. How to use it: Select how much you think bitcoin will overperform stocks, from +5% to +40%. Each return expectation corresponds to a line on the chart. For example, if you think that bitcoin will outperform stocks by 20%, this corresponds to the purple line. Now, follow the line left or right based on how confident you are. If you’re at least 75% confident (a solid “probably”), the purple line lines up with a 4% allocation to bitcoin. Graph represents a hypothetical rendering of confidence of return value based on inputs to the Black-Litterman model. Image does not represent actual performance, either past or present.&nbsp; One of the most interesting things to note is how high your return estimate needs to be and how confident you need to be in order to take a sizable position in bitcoin. For example, for the model to tell you to hold a 10% allocation you need to be highly confident that bitcoin will outperform stocks by 40% each year. Also of note, it does not take much to drive the model’s allocation to 0% allocation, ie: no crypto holdings. If you don’t think that there’s a 50/50 chance that bitcoin will at least slightly outperform, the model says to avoid it entirely. How we got here. The inputs to the Black-Litterman model tell an interesting story in and of themselves. The main inputs into the model are global market caps, which we discussed earlier, asset volatility, and the correlation between assets. It goes without saying that cryptocurrencies are risky. Over the last five years, bitcoin’s volatility was six times that of stocks and 30 times that of bonds. At its worst, the digital coin saw an 80% drop in value, while stocks were down 20%. Other cryptocurrencies fared even worse. Source: Betterment sourced the above ACWI data and Cryptocurrency data from third party sources to create the above visualization. Visualization is meant for informational purposes only and is not reflective of any Betterment portfolio performance. Past performance is not indicative of future results. &nbsp;&nbsp; If an asset is volatile, and one is not able to diversify that volatility away, then investors will require a higher rate of return on that investment, otherwise they will choose not to invest. The fact that bitcoin is so volatile, but has such a small number of investors (relative to stocks or bonds) suggests that many investors still do not see the potential returns worth the risks. On the other hand, cryptocurrencies are at their core a new technology, and new technologies always have an adoption curve. The story here may be less about expected return versus risk and more about early adoption versus mass appeal. The final ingredient in the model is bitcoin’s correlation with stocks and bonds. Bitcoin has some correlation with both stocks and bonds, meaning that when stocks go up (or down), bitcoin may do so as well. The lower the correlation, the greater the diversification an asset provides to your portfolio. Bonds have a low correlation with stocks, which makes them a good ballast against turbulent markets. Bitcoin’s correlation is higher, meaning that it can provide some diversification benefit to a portfolio, but not to the same degree as bonds. Cryptocurrencies can be a component of your financial plan—but it shouldn’t be the only thing. While it can’t tell you if bitcoin will be the next digital gold, this mathematical model can help you think about what kind of allocation to crypto might be appropriate for you and what assumptions about risk and return might be underlying it. Even though Betterment currently doesn’t include cryptocurrency in our recommended investment portfolios, you can learn more about how to invest appropriately in it using our cryptocurrency guide. Since crypto should only comprise a small percentage of your overall portfolio, you should still have a diversified portfolio and long-term investment plan that will help you meet your financial goals. Betterment can help you plan for the short and long term, recommending the appropriate investment accounts that align with your financial goals and allowing you to select your preferred risk-levels. You can also align your investments with your values by using one of our three socially responsible investing portfolios.

      Personal Finance Stories From Our AAPI Community  Members of the Asians of Betterment ERSG share financial advice learned from their parents and the immigrant experience, and how their financial perspectives have shifted over time. Advice is a powerful way of connecting families across generations. In honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, we asked members of our Asians of Betterment community to share personal finance advice from their parents. Financial advice is rooted in our experiences. While our families grew up at different times and in different countries, many still have a shared experience of moving to the United States that left an impact on their advice for how to grow their wealth through saving. Eric Pan, Senior 401(k) Operations Associate: I’ve accumulated subtle frugal habits from my parents since I was a minor. From observing my mom pick off slightly rotten parts of the vegetable prior to checkout so it weighs less, to being scolded for tossing a soda can into the garbage instead of the recycling that could be redeemed for cash at the supermarket, their advice has been ingrained in me. Kim Pham, Brand Designer: We used cash for everything. Credit cards were such a foreign concept to me growing up—I didn’t even get my first card until I almost graduated college. We always had the mentality of not spending what we didn’t have. To this day I still take that to heart, but I also understand the efficiency and importance of credit cards and building credit. Anwesha Banerjee, Legal Counsel: My parents taught me about getting a bank account and a (starter) credit card early and paying it in full each month, to start building good financial habits and credit. Also, they emphasized strong and quick mental math—you can't get cheated if you know your numbers! John Kim, Mobile Engineer: My parents were responsible spenders and liked to save. They taught me not to make purchases off of impulse and I learned how to live within my means happily. Jeff Park, Software Engineer: My family's perception of money has always been heavily influenced by historical events that affected my family over generations. My father's family, for example, were scholars in the nobility class, and for all intents and purposes, they were pretty well-off. My grandfather was a university professor in the early 1920s, but due to his vocal criticism of the Japanese occupation, he and his family were forced to leave their wealth behind as they ran away to China to avoid criminal prosecution. My mother's family also saw their wealth significantly decline due to the Korean War. As both my parents looked abroad for sustainable opportunities, they brought with them an understandable fear that events outside of their control can significantly affect their well-being. Prudence and savings were often preached in my family, and we were always told that it is often better to forego immediate petty pleasures for the peace of mind of a prepared tomorrow. Thi Nguyen, Senior Technical Recruiting Manager: My family comes from humble beginnings, and I remember my dad working every single day and only taking time off when he was sick. We never got any advice directly, but understood that working to earn money was tough. My parents never really cared about material things, but we always had food on the table. It taught me that it's okay to spend money on necessities (food, clothing, housing), but I needed to stay humble in how I spent my money. I learned to be frugal and always love a good deal. "Save where you can, spend when you need to." -Thi Nguyen Taking care of our families always comes first. Family is a recurring theme in the way that our community thinks about finances. Our parents instilled a strong sense of frugality and saving, but taking care of family financially, both at home and abroad, always comes first. Kim Pham, Brand Designer: My parents taught me the importance of spending money on family. When my parents first came here they had to build their own wealth from the ground up, which meant a lot of sacrifice. Our family values spending and sending money to our family here and abroad, more than material possessions. Cat Gonzalez, Product Marketing Manager: My mom always taught me that family comes first with your finances. While you are saving for your own goals, make sure to save enough to take care of your family. Help them make sure they have enough to reach their goals as well. Erica Li, Software Engineer: My family taught me to recognize and prioritize your financial goals. Work towards reaching them even if it means sacrificing from other areas. My dad made $30 a month in China before getting the opportunity to immigrate to the United States. His biggest goal, in addition to learning English and acclimating to an entirely new culture, was to save enough money to bring my mother and I over as well. Once my mother and I settled in the United States, new goals and expenses appeared: buying a house in a good public school district and starting a college fund for me. Saving for these goals wasn't such a smooth journey. My mother had to transition from a stay-at-home role to working alongside my dad as our financial circumstances fluctuated. They took up multiple jobs and sacrificed retirement savings to put money towards these goals. We eventually bought a house in New Jersey, and I was lucky to have had financial support from my parents during my college years. Our financial perspectives shifted over time, too. Part of the beauty of the advice passed from generation to generation is how it evolves and adapts over time. Times change, environments change, knowledge changes and our perspectives shift with that. Our community members, many of whom grew up in a different country than their parents, shared how their personal outlook on finances evolved from that of their families. John Kim, Mobile Engineer: I definitely took after my parents saving habits and learned to expand that mentality through investing. Nima Khavari, Account Executive: Moving to the United States and watching my parents adapt to a consumer driven economy based on access to credit was a significant observation. Remembering them trying to understand credit scores and how to improve it in order to purchase a home left a lasting impression. Erica Li, Software Engineer: Now that I'm all grown up, my parents are no longer putting away money towards goals for my benefit. Alongside catch-up retirement contributions, it makes me happy to see that my parents are finally using their money for pleasure. They recently bought themselves a new car after having their old one for 20 years. Also happy to say that they finally replaced their stove with one that has a working oven! Anonymous: My family made every financial mistake in the book. I can't blame them since they immigrated to this country without knowing English and without a formal financial education. They fell for every scam, pyramid scheme, loan shark, didn't know how credit worked, and lost everything. However, it was an opportunity to learn from their mistakes. After seeing what my parents went through, I learned how credit and financing worked magic, financial planning, and how to recognize cons. I wouldn't be as financially apt if it weren't for their experiences—a huge motivation for why I'm studying for the CFP® exam. The plan is to go back to immigrant communities and warn others from making the same mistakes. Kim Pham, Brand Designer: When I was younger, we didn’t invest and we held all our money in savings accounts. This was a hard habit to unlearn. My entire life growing up my parents would instruct us to put all our money into our savings account, mainly because they didn’t know enough about investing. It helps that I work at Betterment because now I learned how to diversify my portfolio, and that investing isn’t—and shouldn’t be—as hard as it seems.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Goal Projection and Advice Methodology  Betterment helps you get on track to meet your goals by providing projections and advice on allocation, savings, and withdrawals. Our methodology for doing so involves some assumptions worth exploring. TABLE OF CONTENTS Projection Methodology and Assumptions Methodology and Assumptions Withdrawal Advice Methodology and Assumptions For Retirement Goals Graph Explanation Goal Status - On Track or Off Track Limitations Betterment provides allocation, savings and withdrawal advice alongside a projection graph when customers view their goal projection under “Plan.” The graph is intended to show the possible future investment values in order to illustrate the impact of different contribution and withdrawal choices, investment time horizons, and portfolio allocations. Actual individual investor performance has and will vary depending on market performance, the time of the initial investment, amount and frequency of contributions or withdrawals, intra-period allocation changes and taxes. An indication of “On Track” is not a guarantee of achieving a goal in the future. Acting on savings and withdrawal advice is not a guarantee that goals will be met or that the investment will meet cost of living needs throughout one’s life. See our Terms and Conditions. In the following sections, we’ll provide an overview of our methodology and assumptions for each component under “Plan” in a Betterment goal. Projection Methodology and Assumptions The expected investment portfolio returns used in the portfolio value projection results are based on the expected returns and risk free rate assumptions for your target Betterment portfolio allocation. (See more about how the expected returns are derived). This portfolio is set by the user-selected allocation to “stocks” and “bonds”. The allocation choice corresponds to weights of the underlying Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), as defined in our Portfolio. The recommended allocation mix is based on user investment profile including age, the goal type and time horizon. For Cash Goals, the expected return is based on the current APY on Cash Reserve, Betterment’s cash account, and risk free rate assumptions. The returns used are net of your current annual fee and we assume that fee holds throughout the investment. Cash Goals have no fee on your account balance (For Cash Reserve (“CR”), Betterment LLC only receives compensation from our program banks; Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities do not charge fees on your CR balance.), and our projections thus use the current APY when forecasting your Cash Goal account balance. In projecting your balance, we estimate the uncertainty in returns for both your investment portfolio and the underlying risk free rate. For Cash Goals, we assume in our projections that the interest rate for Cash Reserve will vary over time commensurate with any changes to the underlying risk free rate. Monthly Contributions or Withdrawals, if specified, are assumed to be made at the end of the month. We project your balance in monthly increments, never going below twelve months. We project allocation changes on a monthly basis. For users with remaining goal terms of less than one year, our projection assumes that you maintain the allocation at the end of the goal term rather than liquidate. We sometimes map external assets to proxy assets. For investments with available data, we map holdings to our asset classes for risk analysis. In some cases we do not have data for a specific investment, usually because the holding is a non-publicly-listed vehicle, such as a private 401(k) plan. In those cases, we use proxy tickers to determine the appropriate asset class exposures. Proxy tickers are provided by Plaid, our third-party data provider for connected accounts. Plaid uses a proprietary process to identify similar public securities to the unknown ticker using structural information (including security type and fund name) and to qualify the confidence level of the similarity. Betterment uses Plaid’s proxy tickers only for securities that pass a threshold confidence level of similarity. Plaid’s methodology may change over time, and Betterment will continuously evaluate any such changes. The monthly contributions estimate is based on a 60% likelihood of the portfolio value reaching the goal target at the end of the investment term. Calculations assume that you maintain the same portfolio strategy over time. If the portfolio strategy changes over time or has different expected returns, outcomes may be adjusted. Calculations will be updated based on the current portfolio. Charts and graphs are in nominal terms. Withdrawal Advice Methodology And Assumptions For Retirement Income Goals Only The monthly safe withdrawal is based on a 96% likelihood of having $0 or more at the end of the time horizon, assuming the following assumptions hold true. The safe withdrawal amount assumes the user adjusts the withdrawal rate and allocation according to our advice at least once per month. The safe withdrawal amount assumes the user does not live past the specified time horizon (“plan-to-age”). Calculations assume the current Betterment portfolio. If the portfolio changes over time or has different expected returns, outcomes may be adjusted. Calculations will&nbsp;be updated based on the current portfolio held. Withdrawal advice and graphs are in real terms, using an inflation rate of 2% The default time horizon (“plan-to age”) is 90 years of age, or age + 50 years if younger than 40, or age + 10 if older than 80. The model will use this value or the value entered by the user. Graph Explanation The Graph exhibits the possible range of projected portfolio values using color. The dark line indicates the projected portfolio value under average market conditions. This means that there is a 50% likelihood of portfolio values greater than this, and a 50% likelihood of portfolio values less than this. The lighter, shaded region indicates the range within which there is 80% likelihood of the projected portfolio value. This means that there is a 10% likelihood of portfolio values greater than the top of this region, and a 90% likelihood of portfolio values at least as high as the bottom of this region. Goal Status (Savings Goals): On Track Or Off Track The Betterment Savings Advice tool constantly tracks the portfolio performance and indicates the ability of the portfolio to reach the Goal target, assuming average market performance. The portfolio performance is categorized as “On Track” or “Off Track”, and Betterment makes recommendations to increase the likelihood of reaching the Goal target. The portfolio performance is “On Track” when the total projected portfolio value exceeds the Goal target assuming average market performance. This is equivalent to a likelihood of 50% and above of reaching the Goal target. The portfolio performance is “Off Track” when the future projected portfolio value (i.e. current balance plus future contributions, plus investment growth) is not sufficient to reach the Goal target assuming average market performance. This is equivalent to having less than 50% likelihood of reaching the Goal target. Betterment provides advice for bringing the goal back on track in three areas – either increasing the amount of future monthly contributions, or increasing the term of the investment or increasing the current balance in the account by making a one-time deposit. These recommendations are based on a relatively conservative stance, e.g. a 60% likelihood of projected portfolio value to reach the Goal target, compared to the 50% chance used by other models. Limitations The Goal target is a user input and may not be sufficient to provide income for actual spending or retirement income needs. The model does not account for any taxes, except for retirement goals. All non-retirement goal values are assumed to be pre-tax. The model does not account for forced withdrawals such as Required Minimum Distributions that must be taken from pre-tax qualified retirement accounts after a certain age. The model does not account for auto-deposits that are skipped. The savings model is in nominal terms and therefore does not have a direct inflation assumption. (The withdrawal model is in real terms, and uses a 2% inflation assumption). The withdrawal model does not take into account other sources of income outside the Betterment account. A full income plan should include all sources of income and a spending needs analysis. Past performance is not indicative of future results. These projections do not guarantee investment performance. Extreme market conditions, sustained high inflation, or other unforeseen events may reduce portfolio value and withdrawals. Income is not guaranteed.

      Investing in Your 30s: 3 Goals You Should Set Today  It’s never too early or too late to start investing for a better future. Here’s what you need to know about investing in your 30s. In your 30s, your finances get real. Your income may have increased significantly since your first job. You might have investments, stock compensation, or a small business. You may be using or have access to different kinds of financial accounts (e.g. 401(k), IRA, Roth IRA, HSA, 529, UTMA). In this decade of your life, chances are you’ll get married, and even start a family. Even if you’ve taken this complexity in stride, it’s good to take a step back to review where you are and where you want to go. This review of your plan (or reminder to create a plan) is essential to setting up your financial situation for future decades of financial success. Don’t Delay Creating A Plan: Three Goals For Your 30s As always, the best thing to do is start with your financial goals. Keep in mind that goals change through time, and this review is an important step to make updates based on where you are now. If you don’t have any goals yet, or need some guidance on which investing objectives might be important for you, here are three to consider. Emergency Fund Sometimes your plan doesn’t go as planned, and having an adequate emergency fund can help ensure those hiccups don’t affect the rest of your goals. An emergency fund (at Betterment, we call it a Safety Net) should contain enough money to cover your basic expenses for a minimum of three to six months. You may need more than that estimate depending on your career, which may or may not be one in which finding new work happens quickly. Also, depending on how much risk you want to take with these funds, you may need a buffer on top of that amount. Read more about how to calculate your target amount, or follow this simple formula: Monthly Expenditures x Re-Employment Period = Baseline Safety Net Amount As you review your goals, make sure you have established a safety net account. Good options for this include a high-yield cash account like Betterment Cash Reserve, or a Betterment Safety Net. Then, make sure you have enough saved in that account (or are regularly saving into it to build up the balance). Retirement Most people don’t want to work forever. Even if you enjoy your work, you’ll likely work less as you age, presumably reducing your income. To maintain your standard of living, or spend more on travel, hobbies or grandkids, you’ll need to spend from savings. Saving for your retirement early in your career—especially in your 30s–is essential. Thanks to medical improvements and healthier living, we are living longer in retirement, which means we need to save even more. Luckily, you have a secret weapon—compounding—but you have to use it. Compounding can be simply understood as “interest earning interest,”a snowball effect that can build your account balance more quickly over time. The earlier you start saving, the more time you have, and the more compounding can work for you. In your goal review, you’ll want to make sure you are on track to retire according to your plan, and make savings adjustments if not. You’ll also want to make sure you are using the best retirement accounts for your current financial situation, such as your workplace retirement plan, an IRA, or a Roth IRA. Your household income, tax rate, future tax rate and availability of accounts for you and your spouse will determine what is best for you. Use Betterment’s Retirement Planner, which helps answer all of these questions. Also, if you’ve changed jobs, make sure you are not leaving your retirement savings behind, especially if it has high fees. Often, consolidating your old 401(k)s and IRAs into one account can make it easier to manage, and might even reduce your costs. You can consolidate retirement accounts tax-free with a rollover. If you have questions about your plan or the results using our tools, consider getting help from an expert through our Advice Packages. Major Purchases A wedding, a house, a big trip, or college for your kids. Each of these goals has a different amount needed, and a different time horizon. Our goal-based savings advice can help you figure out how to invest and how much to save each month to achieve them. Take the chance in your goal review to decide which of these goals is most important to you, and make sure you set them up as goals in your Betterment account. Our goal features allow you to see, track, and manage each goal, even if the savings aren’t at Betterment.

      The Recommended Allocation To Keep Up With Inflation Has Changed  For funds that seek to match or beat inflation, like a Safety Net goal or Emergency goal, we seek to take on minimal risk while allowing your portfolio the potential growth needed to keep up with inflation. Learn about our updated portfolio allocation recommendations for your emergency funds. At Betterment, we are routinely evaluating our investment strategies to help you achieve your financial goals. As part of that routine evaluation process, we have recently updated our recommended portfolio allocation for goals that seek to keep up with inflation. Goals like our Safety Net goal or an emergency fund are designed to be an account you can withdraw from in the case of an unexpected financial situation, such as a large medical bill or the loss of a job. If your emergency money is sitting out of the market and it’s not invested, it runs the risk of losing buying power over time because of inflation. A key risk to this money is that it loses purchasing power as time goes on. A key aim for such goals is to match—or beat—inflation, so that your dollars can keep as much buying power over time as possible. We updated our recommended allocation for goals that seek to keep up with inflation from 15% stocks to 30% stocks. Based on updated analysis below that considers the current yield curve and inflation expectations, our recommendation is that a 30% stock portfolio is the appropriate allocation for your emergency funds. The chosen allocation is designed to match our assumptions regarding long term inflation. We revisit these assumptions annually, and our assumption for long term inflation is still 2%. As interest rates have moved lower, the yield on low asset assets has also gone down. Now, an investor must take slightly more risk to achieve a return that may beat inflation. Just as they have in the past, these economic conditions could change again in the future—which is why we routinely evaluate our strategies over time. Keeping Inflation At Bay In order to determine the right level of portfolio risk, we need two key pieces of information: The expected return of the portfolio The expected rate of inflation Our current inflation assumption is 2% per year. We review our inflation assumptions annually to make sure they reflect the current economic environment, which is always changing. The expected return of the portfolio has two key components: the risk-free rate and the expected return on risky assets. Yield on U.S. Treasury bonds determines the risk-free rate. Since U.S. Treasury bonds are backed by the U.S. government, they are considered to be virtually risk-free. We also estimate how much additional return we might expect from holding risky assets, such as stocks or corporate bonds. Putting these two pieces together gives us the total expected return for the portfolio. As of January 2021, short-term U.S. Treasury bonds were expected to have a 0.10% annual yield. This means that holding these bonds until they mature will produce about a 0.10% annualized return, which is less than the 2% we need in order to combat inflation, based on our current inflation assumptions. By taking slightly more risk, Betterment seeks to improve on the 0.10% risk-free investment return. Based on our asset class return assumptions, we expect that the total returns for our 30% stock portfolio could potentially be 2.1% after fees*, which is slightly higher than our inflation expectations. We Recommend A Buffer Unfortunately, we can’t predict the future, so the actual performance of our 30% stock portfolio may turn out to be different than our projected assumptions. We can use history to help us understand the range of potential outcomes. Our 30% stock portfolio’s worst performance in a historical backtest would have been -22.9%, during the Great Financial Crisis.** To help protect against a temporary market drop, we recommend that you hold an additional buffer that’s 30% of your target amount—which generally represents at least three months of normal expenses—to insulate against down markets. For example, if three months of expenses is $10,000, we recommend that you hold $13,000 in our goal. Why not just hold cash? Finally, you might be wondering, “Why not just use a bank account for my emergency funds?” It’s a valid question. After all, money in a checking or savings account isn’t subject to market volatility. Most traditional bank accounts don’t pay a high enough interest rate to keep up with inflation. The national average interest rate is 0.04%, which is far below the 2% annual return we need in order to simply match inflation. This means that even though the amount of cash you’re holding is stable, its buying power is still declining over time. We’ll help keep you on track while keeping you informed. Having funds set aside for emergencies is the cornerstone of any financial plan, since it provides an important cushion against unforeseen circumstances—circumstances that might otherwise require you to dip into a long term account, such as retirement. In fact, our advisors routinely recommend that the first investing goal our customers set up should be a goal to protect oneself against unexpected costs, like a medical bill, or loss of income. If you currently have a goal that’s set to the target allocation of our old recommendation—15% stocks—we’ll alert you that your allocation is now considered conservative, and that a more appropriate target allocation for your goal is now 30% stocks. While we won’t adjust your target allocation for you, you’ll be able to adjust your target allocation within your goal either on a web browser or on your mobile app. Before making this update, please note that there may be a tax impact. We’ll show you the estimated tax impact before you complete the change inside of your account. As the economic environment changes, we will continue to review our recommendations. Because we believe in transparency, we’ll keep our customers updated if economic condition shifts lead to a chance in our advice and recommendations. We calculate expected excess returns for the assets in our portfolio by applying a Black-Litterman model, as described in “Computing Forward-Looking Return Inputs” of our . By multiplying these expected returns by our portfolio weights, we can calculate the gross expected excess returns for the portfolio. We can then calculate the expected total return of the portfolio by adding to the expected excess return our estimate of the forward-looking risk-free rate. In this example, we used the lowest point on the US Treasury yield curve as our assumption. The expected returns are net of a 0.25% annual management fee and fund level expenses, and assumes reinvestment of dividends.This expected return is based on a model, rather than actual client performance.&nbsp; Model returns may not always reflect material market or economic factors. All investing involves risk, and there is always a chance for loss, as well as gain. Actual returns can vary. Past performance does not indicate future results. ** The Betterment portfolio historical performance numbers are based on a backtest of the ETFs or indices tracked by each asset class in Betterment’s portfolio as of January 2021. Though we have made an effort to closely match performance results shown to that of the Betterment Portfolio over time, these results are entirely the product of a model. Actual client experience could have varied materially.&nbsp; Performance figures assume dividends are reinvested and daily portfolio rebalancing at market closing prices. The returns are net of a 0.25% annual management fee and fund level expenses. Backtested performance does not represent actual performance and should not be interpreted as an indication of such performance. Actual performance for client accounts may be materially lower. Backtested performance results have certain inherent limitations. Such results do not represent the impact that material economic and market factors might have on an investment adviser’s decision-making process if the adviser were actually managing client money. Backtested performance also differs from actual performance because it is achieved through the retroactive application of model portfolios designed with the benefit of hindsight. As a result, the models theoretically may be changed from time to time and the effect on performance results could be either favorable or unfavorable.&nbsp; See additional disclosure https://www.betterment.com/returns-calculation/.

      Betterment’s Employee Demographics And Our Commitments To Doing Better  We share details on the makeup of Betterment’s employees, our initiatives for diversity and inclusion, and how we’re encouraging progress within the fintech community. TABLE OF CONTENTS Betterment’s Employee Demographic Data Scaling Our Diversity And Inclusion Efforts Conclusion In June, our CEO and Founder Jon Stein made a statement: “Betterment will not stand for the unequal treatment of people of color in our company, in our communities, or in our country. We will advocate for our Black colleagues, friends, and fellow citizens and work harder to build a nation that’s just for all, where we all can pursue happiness, without fear, oppression, or unequal treatment.” Over the last two months, we’ve been hard at work learning how to live up to that promise and take a stand against racial injustice. We’ve formed a coalition with the broader fintech community, we’re increasing our transparency with our employees and our customers, and we’re investing in resources for our employees of color. We acknowledge that these initiatives are a work in progress, but we want to share them with the Betterment community. Betterment’s Employee Demographic Data First, we’d like to share the demographic data of our full-time Betterment team (293 employees as of July 7, 2020). The demographic data below is collected using the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) questions and selections during an employee’s onboarding process. Because of this, the type of information we collected is limited. Starting in 2020, we will provide optional opportunities for additional demographic selections (including but not limited to gender, race, and ethnicity) that are more inclusive for both employees and candidates. Full-Time Employees Leadership Team* *(defined as Director-level or higher): Product, Design, Engineering, And Analytics Teams Engineering Teams We've made progress with gender representation over the past few years, but we still have a long way to go. And our progress in racial and ethnic representation—particularly within our leadership cohort—is not where it should be. We have work to do here, and are committed to ensuring that our team better reflects the communities and customers we serve across the U.S. Scaling Our Diversity And Inclusion Efforts The conversations we’ve had internally as a community, and with your input, are helping inform and drive the sustained change we’re looking to make. We’re working toward a new normal in several ways: Fintech Coalition We recognize that the fintech industry needs to improve access to jobs, career advancement, and financial services, not only for underrepresented groups, but especially for people in the Black and brown community. To hold us and other fintech companies accountable to making this change, we spearheaded the creation of the fintech coalition. Each company that joins the coalition will publish individual plans and provide regular updates on progress toward our commitments to enhancing access to financial services, as well as job and career advancement for people in the Black and brown community. As part of the coalition, we are committed to publicly sharing our representation data on an annual basis each July. Betterment’s Call-to-Action Initiative Immediately following the murder of George Floyd, our employees formed a Call-to-Action (CTA) group. These employees have been brainstorming and executing a number of efforts to unbias our product, increase community outreach, and begin internal educational forums such as book clubs and speaker series. This group is committed to creating change over time, beginning with the following: Betterment is supporting our Black employees in “Calling Out Black” every Friday throughout the summer. Calling Out Black acknowledges the exhaustion, pain, and emotional weight our Black employees might feel in the workplace, especially during times of civil unrest due to police violence. These days provide space for our Black employees to reclaim their mental, emotional, and physical wellbeing. Beginning in 2021, Betterment will recognize Juneteenth as an annual paid holiday to commemorate the ending of slavery in the U.S. We are running a summer education series for our non-Black employees about racial inequality and anti-racist allyship, featuring guest speakers as well as small-group discussions. We’ll be working with Paradigm for a three-part Inclusive Leadership Training series beginning in late July. All managers will go through these sessions that are focused on objectivity, belonging and voice, and the growth mindset. In August, Netta Jenkins will provide company-wide training with her business Holistic Solutions, which will include a discussion forum for Black and brown employees, a session for people managers on how to manage during Black and brown trauma, and two town halls for the entire company. Improve Our Hiring Process Over the last few years, our Recruiting Team has taken steps to expand our new hire sourcing efforts and diversify our interview process. Some of these steps include: Partnering with Jopwell, the leading career advancement platform for Black, Latinx, and Native American professionals to support targeted sourcing of diverse candidates. Allocating funds on a monthly basis to post on underrepresented job boards (e.g., Women In Tech, Women In Product, Black Women in Tech, /dev/color, The Mom Project, etc.) Increasing our geographic diversity by building a remote workforce. We recognize that these efforts have failed to impact the percentage of employees of color at Betterment. Because of this, we have amplified our commitment to this area in four ways: With an employee population that is 70% white, we acknowledge that most folks refer others who look like them. We're pausing our cash referral bonus program to reallocate those funds to support diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) hiring initiatives. Implementing a more streamlined application process where all candidates only need a resume to apply. Continuing to reduce bias in our job descriptions by investing in technology that decodes gendered language; by excluding education requirements; and by including must-have qualities and experience only. Researching and partnering with companies that help us increase our sourcing reach. Increasing Internal Data Collection This summer, we will launch internal surveys to collect broader representation information for both employees and candidates. These surveys will include additional optional self-identification opportunities for racial and ethnic groups, as well as gender. We will share this information with leadership, ERSGs, and our Community Council on a quarterly basis, and will use this information to inform our progress and let us know where we need to focus our efforts. Amplifying Our Employee Resource Strategy Groups (ERSGs) We currently have seven active ESRGs: Black at Betterment, Latinx at Betterment, Asians of Betterment, Women of Betterment, Women in Tech, Betterparents, and Betterpride. Representatives from these groups act as facilitators between their communities and Betterment leadership, as well as participate in our Community Council, a group that meets on a regular basis to further diversity and inclusion initiatives. Through our partnership with Netta Jenkins, we’re investing time in evaluating and improving the structure and reach of our ERSGs. We want to create more open communication between these groups and company leaders, and ensure that these groups are represented as stakeholders in company initiatives. Conclusion Fintech—and Betterment—has been heralded for providing broad and equitable access to financial services, regardless of how much money someone has. While this access is a step forward, it doesn’t directly address the wealth and financial knowledge gaps felt by many people of color—particularly members of the Black and brown community—at the hands of a system that does not treat them equally. We know we haven’t done nearly enough for our community and our employees, and we must do more. Thank you for your feedback and support as we work to do just that.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Why Only “Buying Local” When Investing Is Risky  Currently, U.S. investors may be asking themselves why they should be investing outside of their home country when their own stock market is doing so well. Just a few decades ago, U.S. investors were asking themselves the opposite question. The third quarter of 2019 brought some very positive news for me on a personal level—I received my green card and am now a permanent resident of the United States. If that’s not enough to make me feel patriotic about my newly adoptive country, I needn’t look further than the U.S. equity markets to feel proud. Over the past decade, the American stock market has been incredibly strong, and by some definitions we qualify for having the longest bull market in history. For example, from September 5th, 2011 until September 5th, 2019, the total return of Vanguard’s VTSAX fund, which tracks the total U.S. stock market, was 252%. Vanguard’s VFWIX fund, which tracks world equity markets outside of the U.S., only had a total return of 58% over the same period. Why invest in international stocks? A natural question after hearing this statistic might be: why does Betterment’s portfolio have such a large allocation towards international stocks? After all, our 100% stock portfolio currently has a target allocation of around 40% in international equities. The short answer is that the Betterment portfolio is designed to be representative of the makeup of global investable assets as a whole, and around 40% of the world’s equity assets are invested outside of the U.S. But an international portfolio can also reduce the risk of overweighting one particular country in your portfolio. Home bias can lead to more risks. Some investors choose to overweight their investments in their home country, which is a phenomenon known as home bias. Home bias can expose your portfolio to more risks as it gets less internationally diversified. An especially gut-wrenching example of these risks occurred during this last quarter for Argentinian investors. Latin American investors tend to have strong home bias, with the average Latin American investor tending to allocate 97.5% of their portfolio to Latin American markets—even though only 1.4% of the global capitalization is Latin American. An extremely high local stock market allocation may have been initially positive for Argentinian investors, because their markets grew over 40% in the first eight months of the year. However, on August 12, 2019, the MSCI All Argentina 25/50 Index fell over 24% in just one day. Currently, the index is now seeing overall negative returns for the entire year. Source: Data from Xignite This recent loss was a blow to Argentine equity investors, especially among those with a strong home bias. It’s worth noting that because Argentina and the U.S. are entirely different countries, we generally shouldn’t expect their markets to behave the same. While Argentina is a beautiful country known for its art, dance, food, mountains, and beaches—it’s also currently battling an extremely high inflation rate. The country is currently instituting currency controls to combat the devaluation of the Argentine peso. True diversification helps equip you for the long haul. It’s impossible to predict what will happen with the U.S. stock market going forward. But, we do know that historically, U.S. stocks have also seen long streaks of underperformance compared to international stocks. In the chart below, we plot the 2-year annualized returns of the MSCI EAFE index, which tracks the performance of international developed stocks, and the MSCI USA index, which tracks U.S. equities. Highlighted in gray is any period where international stocks outperformed U.S. stocks. Keep in mind that past performance is not indicative of future performance. Source: Data from MSCI Since the start of the indices, we see that U.S. stocks have outperformed international stocks about 57% of the time. However, until 1990, U.S. stocks only outperformed international stocks 32% of the time. At that time, U.S. investors may have been asking themselves the exact opposite question—why invest in American equities that are lagging international markets? True international diversification means that your portfolio won't likely have the highest returns—but it will also generally be better equipped to handle local crises and downturns. We now live in a globalized world, and your portfolio at Betterment is designed not only to help avoid the risk of local downturns, but to capitalize on global growth over the long term.

      The Benefits of Tax Loss Harvesting+  We’ve automated tax loss harvesting which can help you save on taxes over time. Learn about the benefits of TLH+. Tax loss harvesting is the practice of selling an asset that has experienced a loss. The sold asset is replaced by a similar one, helping to maintain your risk level and your expected returns. By realizing, or "harvesting" a loss, you can: Offset taxes on realized capital gains. Reduce tax liability by reducing your income. Realized losses on investments can offset gains and reduce ordinary taxable income by as much as $3,000 per year. We do this all for you—at no additional cost—with our automated Tax Loss Harvesting+ feature. You could benefit from Tax Loss Harvesting+ if... You are investing in a taxable investment account. You plan to donate to charity or leave your assets to your heirs. The IRS allows you to offset your realized capital gains with realized capital losses. The IRS allows you to reduce up to $3,000 from your ordinary income. We don’t recommend Tax Loss Harvesting+ if... Your future tax bracket will be higher than your current tax bracket. You can currently realize capital gains at a 0% tax rate. Under current law, this may be the case if your taxable income is below $39,375 as a single filer or $78,750 if you are married filing jointly. You are planning to withdraw a large portion of your taxable assets in the next 12 months. You risk causing wash sales due to having substantially identical investments elsewhere.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      How I Managed My Financial Goals When I Got Married  There are many different ways to manage money as a couple. The key is to have open communication, sooner rather than later. A few months before the wedding, one of my groomsmen asked me if I had thought about how my fiancée and I would combine finances. It sparked an interesting conversation, as he and I then realized we had very different views on the best way to manage money as a couple. Of course, every relationship is different and there is no silver bullet for reducing money-related stress within a partnership. However, we consider ourselves lucky to have found a system that works well for us early on. After all, a study found that financial problems were cited as a cause for the breakdown of relationships by at least one of the partners in 56% of divorced couples — a sobering statistic to be sure. In this article, I’ll share some of the personal finance practices that worked well for my wife and me: proactive budgeting, allocating every dollar in our budget to a goal, and speaking openly and often about our financial priorities. Here’s what worked for us: We quickly decided to join our finances. My wife and I met in college. After a few months of dating, we both knew we were in the relationship for the long haul and our approach to finances changed radically. Even before we moved in together, we made it a point to foster a philosophy of “what’s mine is yours.” One common way couples manage their finances is to set up a joint account from which all bills are paid, and each partner keeps a separate account for “mine” and “your” spending. In contrast, we approached budgeting in almost the exact opposite way— every expense was “ours,” and we also set our budgeting goals together. One month I might have needed a suit for a job interview and another month she might have needed some repairs done to her car. Either way, we considered both of these expenses as shared, and didn’t keep track of who paid for what. Of course, this approach might have complicated things if our relationship had not turned out as well as it had. If we had broken up a few months into our relationship, one of us may have felt cheated by the fact that more expenses were paid for by their account. However, I credit our approach to finances as part of the reason why our relationship was so solid in the first place. I don’t think my wife and I have ever had an argument about our finances, and by setting common goals and budgets early on, we were able to avoid one of the largest relationship stressors. 3 Tips For Managing Joint Finances Our strategy for managing finances has remained mostly the same since our college days. For budgeting, we use the envelope system, which relies on giving all of your cash a purpose. Every cent that flows into one of our accounts is earmarked for a specific need. One very tedious way of following this technique is to keep all your money in cash, and physically store it inside separately labelled envelopes (hence the name). If the grocery envelope has $100 on it, then that’s your budget for groceries until you have more cash inflow to distribute among your envelopes. Of course, you can simplify this system by having software track your cash digitally. 1. Develop a proactive vs. reactive budget. First, our budget is proactive rather than reactive. Many popular budgeting apps aggregate your transactions and let you see how much money was already spent on what, but they don’t actually help you plan out your future goals. We use the app YNAB, though a simple spreadsheet could get you most of the way there. Keeping track of your spending in such detail may sound taxing, but it has many benefits. By giving every dollar a job, we know what our spending will look like ahead of time, and we can focus on saving for the long-term. 2. Adopt the “envelope” system. Secondly, the envelope system helps you smooth out seasonal spending patterns over time. For example, we have a dedicated category for Christmas gifts to which we allocate a few dollars every month. Though buying holiday gifts may not seem top of mind in February, allocating to that category year round means that once December rolls around, we have a full “digital envelope” of cash solely dedicated to buying gifts. Though the physical spending may vary month-to-month, the amount we contribute to each category is very steady. I think of this as almost like a self-sponsored credit card, where we have low monthly payments every month, instead of a large payment all at once. 3. Speak openly and frequently about future priorities. Thirdly, taking a proactive approach to budgeting means that my wife and I regularly have conversations about our hopes and priorities for our finances. A budget that summarizes what you spent last month will do very little to make you think about your future goals, but our budget has categories for things like future vacations, a home-purchase, and school fees for children we don’t even have yet. Strange as it sounds, I think we’ve had some of the most enriching conversations of our relationship while doing our budgeting. There is no one-size-fits all solution for how to manage finances as a couple. Indeed, even initiating the conversation about managing money can be daunting. Yet, since communication is key, I remain a firm believer that early, open conversations about what works best for you and your partner are not only critical for the relationship but also an incredible opportunity to work towards your dreams, together. Whether you choose a proactive budget or a reactive budget, whether you begin merging your finances sooner or later (or at all), and whether you review and adjust your approach often or occasionally, take the fear out of talking money. More than anything, budgeting together is an opportunity to discuss what is most important to you—a chance to start on a path towards goals for which you are excited to reach together. Some might say those are the very best parts of a relationship.

      Introducing Our Smart Beta Portfolio Strategy by Goldman Sachs  A smart beta portfolio strategy reflects the underlying principles of Betterment’s core portfolio strategy, while seeking higher returns by deviating away from market capitalization in and across asset classes. When it comes to investing in the market, a portfolio strategy should be well aligned with your personal goals and disposition to bear market risks. If you are seeking to outperform a conventional, market-cap portfolio strategy, despite the potential to experience underperformance, our analysis shows there may be a more effective strategy for you. Today, we’re introducing a smart beta portfolio, sourced from Goldman Sachs Asset Management, to help meet the preference of our customers who are willing to take on additional risks to potentially outperform a market capitalization strategy. This smart beta portfolio strategy reflects the same underlying principles that have always guided the core Betterment portfolio strategy—investing in a globally diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. The difference is that the smart beta portfolio strategy seeks higher returns by moving away from market capitalization weightings in and across equity asset classes. What is a smart beta portfolio strategy? Industry insiders often describe portfolio strategies as either passive or active. Most index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are categorized as “passive” because they track the returns of the underlying market based on asset class. By contrast, many mutual funds or hedge fund strategies are considered “active” because an advisor or fund manager is actively buying and selling specific securities to attempt to beat their benchmark index. The result is a dichotomy in which a portfolio gets labeled as passive or active, and investors infer possible performance and risk based on that label. In reality, portfolio strategies reside within a plane where passive and active are just two cardinal directions. Smart beta funds, like the ones we’ve selected for this portfolio, seek to achieve their performance by falling somewhere in between extreme passive and active, using a set of characteristics, called “factors,” with an objective of outperformance while managing risk. The portfolio strategy also incorporates other passive funds to achieve appropriate diversification. This alternative approach is also the reason for the name “smart beta.” An analyst comparing conventional portfolio strategies usually operates by assessing beta, which measures the sensitivity of the security to the overall market. In developing a smart beta approach, the performance of the overall market is seen as just one of many factors that affects returns. By identifying a range of factors that persistently drive returns, we seek market-beating performance while managing reasonable risk. When we develop and select new portfolio strategies at Betterment, we operate using five core principles of investing: Personalized planning A balance of cost and value Diversification Tax optimization Behavioral discipline The Goldman Sachs Smart Beta portfolio strategy aligns with all five of these principles, but the strategy configures cost, value, and diversification in a different way than Betterment’s core portfolio. In order to pursue higher overall returns, the smart beta strategy adds additional systematic risk factors that are summarized in the next section. Additionally, the strategy seeks to achieve global diversification across stocks and bonds while overweighting specific exposures to securities included in Betterment’s core portfolio, such as real estate investment trusts (REITs). Meanwhile, with the smart beta portfolio, we’re able to continue delivering all of Betterment’s tax-efficiency features, such as tax loss harvesting and Tax Coordination. Investing in smart beta strategies has traditionally been more expensive than a pure market cap-weighted portfolio. The Goldman Sachs Smart Beta portfolio strategy has a far lower cost than the industry average, with aggregate annual ETF expense ratios ranging from 0.11% to 0.24%, depending on the portfolio’s allocation between stocks and bonds. This is slightly more expensive than the core Betterment portfolio strategy, which has aggregate annual ETF expense ratios of only 0.07% to 0.16%, depending on the portfolio’s allocation. Note: Expense ratios data are from Xignite as of August 30, 2017 Because a smart beta portfolio incorporates the use of additional systematic risk factors, we typically only recommend this portfolio for investors who have a high risk tolerance and plans to save for the long term. Which “factors” drive the Goldman Sachs Smart Beta portfolio strategy? Factors are the variables that drive performance and risk in a smart beta portfolio strategy. If you think of risk as the currency you spend to achieve potential returns, factors are what determine the underlying value of that currency. As analysts, we can dissect a portfolio’s return into a linear combination of factors. In academic literature and practitioner research (Vanguard,&nbsp;Research Affiliates,&nbsp;AQR), factors have been shown to drive historical returns. These analyses form the backbone of our advice for using the smart beta portfolio strategy. Factors reflect economically intuitive reasons and behavioral biases of investors in aggregate, all of which have been well studied in academic literature. Most of the equity ETFs used in this portfolio are Goldman Sachs ActiveBetaTM, which are Goldman Sach’s factor-based smart beta equity funds. The factors used in these funds are equal weighted and include the following: 1. Good Value When a company has solid earnings (after-tax net income), but has a relatively low price (i.e., there’s a relatively low demand by the universe of investors), its stock is considered to have good value. Allocating to stocks based on this factor gives investors exposure to companies that have high growth potential but have been overlooked by other investors. 2. High Quality High-quality companies demonstrate sustainable profitability over time. By investing based on this factor, the portfolio includes exposure to companies with strong fundamentals (e.g., strong and stable revenue and earnings) and potential for consistent returns. 3. Low Volatility Stocks with low volatility tend to avoid extreme swings up or down in price. What may seem counterintuitive is that these stocks also tend to have higher returns than high volatility stocks. This is recognized as a persistent anomaly among academic researchers because the higher the volatility of the asset, the higher its return should be (according to standard financial theory). Low-volatility stocks are often overlooked by investors, as they usually don’t increase in value substantially when the overall market is trending higher. In contrast, investors seem to have a systematic preference for high-volatility stocks based on the data and, as a result, the demand increases these stocks’ prices and therefore reduce their future returns. There are some interesting hypotheses behind this preference. One suggests that investors treat high-volatility stocks as lotteries and are therefore willing to accept lower expected returns by paying a premium to gamble on these stocks. 4. Strong Momentum Stocks with strong momentum have recently been trending strongly upward in price. It is well documented that stocks tend to trend for some time, and investing in these types of stocks allows you to take advantage of these trends. It’s important to define the momentum factor with precision since securities can also exhibit reversion to the mean—meaning that “what goes up must come down.” How can these factors lead to future outperformance? In specific terms, the factors that drive the smart beta portfolio strategy—while having varying performance year-to-year relative to their market cap benchmark—tend to outperform their respective benchmarks when combined, with a high degree of persistence. You can see an example of this in the chart of yearly factor returns for US large cap stocks below. You’ll see that although the ranking of the four factor indexes varies over time, the ranking of the equally weighted index returns is relatively stable and performs better than the S&amp;P 500 most of the years. Hypothetical Performance Ranking of Smart Beta Indices vs. S&amp;P 500 This chart is for illustrative purposes only, and the factor returns it references are not necessarily the same factor returns in the Goldman Sachs Smart Beta portfolio strategy. The chart above compares annual returns (data from Bloomberg) for the period from January 2000 to August 2017 and is used to illustrate the points discussed in this article. For each year, we have ranked the annual performance of each factor alongside an equal weighting of all four factors, using the S&amp;P 500 as a comparison. The returns for Momentum, Quality, Value and Low volatility are calculated from the S&amp;P 500 Momentum Index, S&amp;P 500 Value Index, S&amp;P 500 Quality Index and S&amp;P Low-volatility Index, respectively. “Equal weighting of all four factors” was calculated by Betterment by giving each factor corresponding to each index listed above an equal weight to yield the hypothetical performance figures. This calculation was not provided by Goldman Sachs Asset Management. This analysis is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect or predict future performance. Moreover, this analysis does not include fees, liquidity, and other costs associated with actually holding a portfolio based on these exact indexes that would lower returns of the portfolio. Why invest in a smart beta portfolio? As we’ve explained above, we generally only advise using Betterment’s choice smart beta strategy if you wish to attempt to outperform a market-cap portfolio strategy in the long term despite potential periods of underperformance. For investors who fall into such a scenario, our analysis, supported by academic and practitioner literature, shows that the four factors above can persistently drive higher returns than a portfolio that uses market weighting as its only factor. While each factor weighted in the smart beta portfolio strategy has specific associated risks, some of these risks have low or negative correlation, which allow for the portfolio design to offset constituent risks and control the overall portfolio risk. Of course, these risks and correlations are based on historical analysis, and no advisor could guarantee their outlook for the future. An investor who elects the Goldman Sachs Smart Beta portfolio strategy should understand that the potential losses of this strategy can be greater than those of market benchmarks. In the year of the dot-com collapse of 2000, for example, when the S&amp;P 500 dropped by 10%, the S&amp;P 500 Momentum Index&nbsp;lost 21% (see chart above). Given the systematic risks involved, we believe the evidence that shows that smart beta factors can lead to higher expected returns relative to market cap benchmarks, and thus, we are proud to offer the portfolio for customers with long investing horizons and a high degree of comfort with the risks involved. To get started, create a new goal account and select the Goldman Sachs Smart Beta portfolio strategy. Or, if you’re not yet a Betterment customer, open an account with our smart beta portfolio strategy. Factors, as applied in investing, can mean different things. In the context of asset allocation, factors are drivers of return within broader asset classes used as a lens to uncover return potential and minimize risk. The Goldman Sachs Smart Beta portfolios examine market capitalization, rates, emerging markets, credit, equity style, commodities and momentum to seek to avoid taking unnecessary risk while pursuing the best opportunities to drive portfolio returns.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Retirement Income Shouldn’t Be a Guessing Game  Betterment’s Retirement Income goal takes the guess work out of your most important retirement question: Will I run out of money? When it comes to creating a cash flow strategy for retirement you need the answer to one important question: “Will I have enough money to last a lifetime?” In today’s low-yield environment—and given most people’s longer lifespans—your retirement savings need to keep working for you long after your earning years are over. And you need to know how much of it you can withdraw safely to stay the course over the coming decades. That may sound like a complicated formula—but Betterment has been working hard on this problem to make it easy for you to get the answers. We launched an&nbsp;online retirement income solution that features an automated, dynamic withdrawal strategy, built on top of a low-cost, fully liquid portfolio with dynamic asset allocation. A Dynamic Approach to Retirement Income Betterment’s investing team has developed an income solution to provide dynamic retirement planning. Unlike traditional services, our income advice and allocation adjusts over time with your age, portfolio value, risk, and your withdrawal rate. Your money is invested in our globally diversified portfolio of 12 asset classes. Based on sophisticated algorithms, our Retirement Income&nbsp;service factors in your personal information to offer the optimal&nbsp;risk allocation across our globally diversified portfolio of ETFs and advises on the optimal&nbsp;amount for safe withdrawal for the coming year, while balancing the dual concerns of maximizing total income, and year-to-year income consistency. Both allocation and income advice are offered through Betterment’s existing portfolio and platform—so no matter your level of investing expertise, it’s time-efficient and easy to manage. The result is that income is variable, changing from year to year depending on portfolio balance and other factors. Over time, this flexibility can extend your capital if necessary, preventing the portfolio from being depleted prior to the end of your selected time horizon. To be sure, this kind of variability might not work for every retiree, but as part of a total&nbsp;of a total return strategy, this income goal is designed to extend money for as long as you it need to last. Expert Design The design for Betterment’s Retirement Income was led by product manager Alex Benke, CFP®, who is a second-generation financial planner and spent 10 years at J.P. Morgan before joining Betterment, and Lisa Huang, who holds a Ph.D in Physics from Harvard University and worked as a quantitative strategist at Goldman Sachs. Benke and Huang evaluated various withdrawal methods at a wide range of allocations using a Monte Carlo simulation for testing thousands of trial-run market scenarios. As part of their analysis, they tested the viability of the popular but flawed 4% rule—finding that a dynamic withdrawal and allocation strategy is clearly a better solution to maximize total income while making it likely&nbsp;that the money will last for the specified period. Why Betterment’s Solution Is Better Many of the existing retirement services and strategies rely on static withdrawals—outmoded for today’s low-yield environment, global economy and people’s longer lives.&nbsp;The shortcomings of other services can mean that you may miss out on much needed growth, or, as with annuities, you get some predictability at the cost of liquidity, which can be constraining. Consider the failings of the 4% rule—a popular retirement strategy developed in the 1990s and designed to provide a steady stream of income—which, under current conditions is expected to lead to portfolio depletion about 30% of the time, analysis by Benke and Huang showed. Read more here on why the 4% rule is broken.&nbsp; Betterment’s innovation is to make income advice fully dynamic—regularly adjusting in response to multiple variables—and to fully automate that advice, integrated with our efficient, low-cost global portfolio.&nbsp;Just as the income advice, so goes the underlying asset allocation, fully dynamic, adjusted along a glide path over time to reflect a shifting risk tolerance. Our advice for a safe annual withdrawal rate would generally range from 2% to 10%, based over time on a host of factors, including your portfolio's balance. We advocate a yearly adjustment to your auto-withdrawal setting (i.e. income) to stay on track with advice. Our model was designed to maximize total withdrawals while minimizing withdrawal variation. What Do We Mean by 'Safe'? With the 4% rule, and other strategies,&nbsp;a less than 10% chance of ruin (i.e. your balance is zero) was historically considered safe. But our research showed that with current market conditions, the 4% rule actually leads&nbsp;to ruin about 30% of the time. Not so safe after all. Betterment's Retirement Income is designed so that you have less than 4% chance of running out of money. Furthermore, the chance of your withdrawal amount falling below a 2% threshold of your initial balance is only about 10%. Using our advice means your chance of running out of money is 4% or less. In other words—you are more than 96% likely to have income throughout your chosen time horizon by following our advice. Unlike products like annuities, any remaining investments are fully&nbsp;liquid—meaning your heirs will have access to the money, even if income is no longer necessary. Understanding Variable Income: An Example Margaret is a 65-year-old college professor, and she is likely to live to 85 based on her family history and health. Using Betterment’s income service, her $500,000 Roth IRA is allocated for a 20-year time horizon at 56% stocks and her expected monthly withdrawal this year is $1,941—an annual rate of 4.65%. This is not her only income—she also has income from Social Security, a pension, and 401K. If the markets go up: In the first year, her Betterment portfolio grows by 7% and her new balance is $510,000 even after a year of making withdrawals. She’s a year older, however, and now her new recommended allocation is slightly less risky. Margaret’s monthly withdrawal rate will now be about $2,062 (about 4.85% of the new portfolio balance, but about 4.95% of the original value). If the markets go down: If instead the markets were down 7%, her new balance would be $443,338 after the withdrawals. The new withdrawal rate will be $1,791 per month, or $150 lower than the original starting withdrawal amount, and 4.30% of the original value. Although the withdrawal amounts do change depending on Margaret's portfolio performance, her average withdrawal over 20 years is expected to be around $2,503 assuming an average market return of 6%. It's exactly this dynamic withdrawal strategy that makes it likely her capital will last for the full 20 years. To be sure, every retiree can customize his or her time horizon. How to Get Started To get started, any Betterment customer who has designated herself as a retiree can access a goal type called Retirement Income. With this goal, Betterment’s algorithm then calculates a safe withdrawal amount and advises an allocation. Lastly, retirees can set up an automatic withdrawal from their Betterment income goal to their checking account to maintain fluid cash flow on a personalized payment schedule. The Results Monthly income may be a formula after all—but the peace of mind knowing that your money is more than 96% likely to last for however long you specify goes far beyond a spreadsheet.&nbsp;Like all our services, our income solution receives all the benefits of Betterment—security, automated investment management, global portfolio diversification, and tax efficiency.&nbsp;We believe we’ve developed an innovation that works for you, combining personalization and control with security and trust.

      Why the 4% Rule Is Broken  There are fundamental flaws in the popular 4% rule for retirement income, including its reliance on a higher yield environment. &nbsp; In today's economy, you need a better, more dynamic approach to planning your retirement income. For the last 20 years, many retirees have relied on the so-called 4% rule when determining how much of their nest egg to spend each year. As the name implies, the rule is notable for its simplicity: as long as you withdraw no more than 4% of your initial portfolio, adjusted for inflation, you shouldn't run out of money. That rule is now being called into doubt—and for good reason. In today’s more volatile, lower-yield climate, this flat-rate withdrawal approach can put you at greater risk of outliving your money, or living on less than you could. Recent research has caused considerable debate, and sparked some much-needed innovation around that old guideline. A rigorous new study led by Betterment’s quantitative portfolio specialist Lisa Huang finds that applying the 4% rule under current market conditions is expected to prematurely deplete a retirement portfolio 30% of the time, assuming 3% inflation and a 30-year retirement.1 To arrive at this conclusion, we ran a Monte Carlo simulation to test thousands of trial futures, with the results presented in the chart below. Our research led to the creation of Betterment’s new&nbsp;retirement income&nbsp;product, released in April 2014. Our online retirement solution automates withdrawals, calculated based on a dynamic formula, fully integrated with an automated, low-cost, liquid portfolio.&nbsp;The algorithms are optimized to ensure that there is less than a 4% chance of running out of money—and a 90% chance that the annual withdrawal amount never drops below 2% of the initial portfolio balance (with the annual withdrawals expected to be above 4% on average, often significantly so.) The quest for stability Credit for the 4% rule belongs to Bill Bengen, a financial planner in California, whose&nbsp;research on the topic was first published in the&nbsp;Journal of Financial Planning&nbsp;in&nbsp;the early 1990's.&nbsp;Bengen came up with a formula for what seemed to be a safe withdrawal rate that would accomplish the top goals of retirees: Provide a fixed rate of withdrawal, like an annuity Rely on an easy-to-use withdrawal formula (unlike, say, required minimum distributions) Minimize retirees’ risk of running out of money However, while the 4% figure remained fixed in the public's imagination, the rates it relied on were anything but. Twenty years ago, the yield on a three-month Treasury bill was 6%. So while Bengen’s model called for a 50/50 stock allocation, even those with a more conservative asset allocation could still draw down 4% annually adjusted for inflation, and reasonably expect to preserve their capital. Even in 2002, the 5-year US Treasury yield was still 4.5%. That’s no longer the case—today a three-month Treasury is .04% and a 5-year is around 1.67%. In fact at least one paper has speculated that the apparent success of the 4% rule during the last 20 years may have been dependent on specific market conditions—which have become less and less favorable—and called its success an “anomaly.” It makes sense that the rule’s rise to popularity was a happy accident when you consider that the first decade after Bengen created his model was an exceptional time of low inflation and high corporate earnings in the U.S. A fly in the ointment But even without changes in the economic climate, the last couple of decades have highlighted several other, fundamental flaws in Bengen's approach: The 4% rule is based on the portfolio’s initial balance; subsequent market performance isn’t dynamically factored into the withdrawal rate—even though it can dramatically affect the portfolio’s balance. Flat-rate withdrawals that ignore dramatic market changes can lead to premature portfolio depletion. Likewise, a flat withdrawal rate doesn’t take into account personal changes in health or lifestyle that naturally occur with age. Many retirees need more flexibility in their cash flow to handle the inevitable ups and downs of life. &nbsp;In particular, an unfavorable market climate in the early years of retirement, coupled with a rigid withdrawal formula, increases the risk of asset depletion, because capital preservation during those early years is critical to the portfolio’s ongoing growth. Conversely, if returns are higher than expected in the early phase of retirement, but your withdrawals are static, you run the risk leaving money on the table at the end of your life that could have been used for greater enjoyment in previous years. The quest for a sustainable spending model Understandably, many retirees prefer fixed withdrawal rates because they’re predictable—that’s why annuities are popular. But several companies, including Betterment, find that retirees fare much better with a dynamic withdrawal strategy over the long-term (without the restrictions of annuities). Betterment’s Retirement Income service continually factors in a retirement portfolio's balance, projected inflation as well as retirees’ personal information, to come up with a dynamic asset allocation and spending plan that retirees can follow automatically—or further customize&nbsp;with a few clicks on their digital dashboard. Learn more about Betterment's new Retirement Income service. Generally, you can expect to withdraw more than 4% per year, depending on your age and risk profile. The initial portfolio starts with a 56% stock allocation and we use highly responsive algorithms within the product to factor in portfolio performance and create a glide path that’s designed to stave off longevity risk and preserve capital. By contrast, the two other companies that now offer retirees a similar, dynamic spending model only approach the issue from a financial planning standpoint, as opposed to advice that is actually implemented in an automated fashion. Last fall, Vanguard announced a new dynamic spending model for retirees which combines aspects of the 4% rule with the percentage-of-portfolio approach, in which you calculate a new withdrawal percentage each year, but don’t factor in inflation. This hybrid strategy sets a floor and a ceiling for withdrawals, based on the prior year. And in March 2014, J.P. Morgan Asset Management announced a dynamic retirement income withdrawal strategy. This proprietary model combines five key factors (including life expectancy, assets and forward-looking market projections) to create a customized portfolio and spending plan that retirees can adjust as needed with their advisers. However, neither of these two products are currently integrated with a live portfolio that automates the advice and the glide path—as well as the withdrawals—the way Betterment does. Out with the old, in with the new Dealing with a variable retirement income from year to year is a relatively new idea. Fortunately the Betterment model is designed to provide stability. The algorithms are optimized to balance the dual objectives of maximizing lifetime withdrawals, and keeping the withdrawal amount within a consistent range year after year. Best of all, by working with some natural ups and downs in your income from year to year, you’re actually improving your overall outcome. With the Betterment income strategy, there is less than 4% chance you will run out of money. 1We found the expected failure rate of the 4% rule under current conditions to be 31% when applied to a Betterment portfolio with a 30% stock allocation. Though analysis marshaled in support of the 4% heuristic in the 1990's tended to recommend a 50% stock allocation (e.g. the&nbsp;seminal Trinity study&nbsp;from 1998), these studies generally assumed a simple two-asset allocation between an S&amp;P 500 fund and high grade bonds - sometimes referred to as the "naive" portfolio. The Betterment portfolio, with global diversification in both the stock and bond basket, has both higher volatility and higher expected returns&nbsp;at the same allocation to stocks. &nbsp;A 50% stock naive portfolio has the expected volatility of a 33% stock Betterment portfolio and the expected returns of a 26% stock Betterment portfolio. Accordingly, to test the assumptions of the 4% rule as applied to a two-asset portfolio at 50% stocks, we are highlighting the Monte Carlo results using a 30% stock Betterment portfolio. Notably, we found that applying the 4% rule even to a 50% stock Betterment portfolio is expected to fail 21% of the time under modern market conditions.

      How to Save with Betterment  Believe it or not, there is an art to saving money. Here are Betterment’s tips on how you can save effectively for your financial goals. Believe it or not, there’s an art to saving money. It’s not a static process with rigid guidelines. How much you need to save and how you do it changes with your circumstances. You react and adjust to life. But with the right techniques and tools, you can be equipped to make the choices that are best for you, whatever your situation. Here are some tips on how to effectively save for your financial goals with Betterment. In this guide, we’ll: Help you determine how much to save Walk you through the strategy behind making deposits Explain how Betterment is built to optimize your account Talk about how you can adapt to market conditions How Betterment determines how much you need to save Tell us the goal you want to reach, your target amount, and the date you want to reach it by (your time horizon), and we’ll show you how much we recommend saving each month to help get you there. That number acts as a starting point, but it’s flexible. We’ll provide you with a goal projection and forecaster to reflect the likelihood of hitting your goal, but we can’t predict the future. But that doesn’t mean you need to constantly change the amount you save. Instead, we recommend a simple strategy called a “savings ratchet.” A savings ratchet means you increase how much you save when you have to, but you don’t decrease it afterward. By ratcheting your savings rates, you may end up with greater final portfolio values. How to choose the right deposit strategy for your goals It may not seem like a big deal, but how and when you make deposits can affect your outcome and your experience. So it’s worth considering the options and their implications. Deposit types There’s more than one way to make a deposit in Betterment. Here’s what you can do: One-time deposits are exactly what they sound like. Choose the amount to transfer and where you want it to go, and the transfer happens once. This works well when you have extra cash to invest, but it isn’t ideal as a long-term strategy. Just imagine how much time you’d spend logging in and manually making transfers over the years! Recurring deposits eliminate the manual process. You set it up once, and we’ll automatically transfer the set amount from your bank account on the frequency of your choice: weekly, every other week, monthly, or on two set dates per month. Recurring deposits are a great option if you know how much you want to deposit on an ongoing basis. We’ll send a confirmation email before a scheduled recurring deposit, giving you a chance to skip the auto-deposit if needed. Deposit timing Setting up your deposits to occur the day after each paycheck is an effective auto-deposit strategy. The extra day gives your paycheck time to settle in your bank account before we start the transfer, but you’ll usually want that transfer to happen as quickly as possible. There are three main reasons for this: Paying yourself first. Scheduling your auto-deposits for right after you get paid lets you separate your paycheck into two categories: savings and spending. From a behavioral standpoint, this protects you from yourself. Your paycheck goes toward your financial goals first, and you’re free to use any remaining cash in your checking account for other spending needs. Avoiding idle cash. When your cash sits in a traditional bank account, it typically earns very little interest at best—often none at all. In times of inflation, which is most of the time, your cash is actually losing value. Letting it sit may also tempt you to try timing the market, holding on to it for even longer because of market activity. Idle cash could cause you to miss out on dividend payments or coupon income events too. Reducing your taxes. Regular and frequent deposits and dividends can help us rebalance your portfolio more tax-efficiently, keeping you at the appropriate risk level without realizing unnecessary capital gains taxes when possible. We use the incoming cash to buy investments in asset classes where you’re underweight, instead of selling investments in asset classes where you’re overweight. Even small amounts allow us to invest your money in fractional shares. To get started with auto-deposits on a web browser, first log in then head to New Transfers and choose the deposit option. Or on the mobile app, log in and choose the Deposit button that will appear at the bottom of the screen. How Betterment helps keep your goals on track Want to stay on track to reach your goals? Then your investments are going to need some maintenance. Betterment uses five strategies aimed to optimize your account and help you reach your goals. We can automatically adjust your allocations Generally speaking, the closer your goal is, the less risk you should take. There’s less time for the market to recover, so a sudden dip could set you back. This is why our auto-adjust feature is so valuable for some goals. Here’s how it works: When setting up a goal, you tell us your time horizon. We recommend an initial risk level. If auto-adjust is eligible and selected, we gradually decrease your risk level as your eligible goal approaches its end date. All investing includes some risk. Auto-adjust can’t entirely eliminate that, but it does help protect your portfolio by gradually shifting away from riskier investments (like stocks) into safer investments (like bonds). We recommended conservative savings amounts Once you’ve set up your goals and provided a target savings amount, we provide a recommended deposit amount and cadence, based on our projections for how the market may perform. To be on the safe side and give you a bit of a buffer, we base this contribution estimate on a below-average market outcome. More specifically, we aim for a 60% likelihood of reaching your goal by the end of the investment term. We help you plan for the worst-case scenario Sometimes you want extra certainty that you’ll reach your goal in time. This might be the case when: The goal’s time horizon is not flexible. The goal is very important to you. You prefer to be conservative with your finances. If any of these apply, you may want to look at our projection graphs to see how very poor markets might affect your goal. Hovering your cursor over the graph shows not just average expected performance, but also how your goal could fare depending on market performance. The very poor market outcome is indicated by the 90% chance of having at least that amount. Many investors want a 90% chance for reaching certain goals. In that case, you may want to consider increasing your savings amount. We send you reminders to update your goals Even when markets behave as expected, changing life circumstances may require you to update your goals. It’s best practice to periodically check in on your goals and see if you need to make adjustments. You should also review your financial profile to ensure your income level, tax bracket, marital status, and address are all correct. We tell you if your goals go off track Betterment makes it easy to see how your goals are doing and whether you should make changes. Based on your goal type, its time horizon and target amount, we can provide guidance on whether your goal is on track. If it’s not, we’ll show you what changes you can make to help fix it. How Betterment’s recommendations change with the market Even with the best strategies in place, sometimes the market just doesn’t perform the way we want it to. So what happens if you’re no longer on track to reach your goal? There’s no magic solution, but Betterment has some recommendations to help your goal get back on track: Delay your goal Some goals have timelines that are more flexible than others. Moving back your timeline can give your portfolio a chance to recover. It also gives you extra time to save more. You can use the Goal Forecaster within your goal to see how big of an impact the delay could have. Downsize your goal If a smaller target amount will still let you accomplish what you need to do, you may not need to change your timeline or take other actions. You can adjust the target amount to see what effect it will have on the timeline and recommended deposits for reaching your goal. This only works if you’re willing to accept a smaller target amount for your goal. Increase your savings amount Putting more toward your goal each month can help you catch up to your original target. You can increase your auto-deposit amount at any time. It’s easier said than done, but temporarily cutting back on discretionary spending may be the key to reaching your goal. For goals like emergency funds, where you don’t want to decrease your target amount and you want to reach it as soon as possible, the short-term sacrifice can be worth the long-term security. Divert money from other goals Transferring money from another account (like a goal that’s ahead of schedule) can help get you back on track. Just be careful you aren’t robbing your future self to fulfill your immediate needs. You can transfer money between non-IRA/non-401(k) investment goals from within your account by performing a goal-to-goal transfer. Just choose the goal you want to move money out of, click on “Transfer or Rollover,” and then click “Transfer to another goal.” You’ll sometimes need a combination of more than one—or even all—of these options. For example, if you can save an extra $100 per paycheck, delay your goal by three months, and also use some money from another goal, that may be your formula to get back on track.

      How to Choose the Right Investment Accounts for Your Financial Goals  From 401(k)s to 529s, investment accounts vary in purpose. Learn the differences and which are better suited for your different long-term financial goals. Investment accounts are valuable tools for reaching your long-term financial goals. But they’re not all the same. Choosing the right investment account – or mix of multiple account types – could mean reaching your goal ahead of schedule, or having more finances to work with. But choosing the wrong account type could mean your money isn’t available when you need it. The right investment account depends on your plans for the future. Maybe you’re thinking about retirement or saving for your child’s college education. Perhaps you’re trying to pass on as much of your assets to your loved ones as possible. Or you might just be trying to earn more interest than you could expect from a traditional savings account or certificate of deposit (CD). Knowing your goal is the first step to choosing the right investment account. In general, you’ll end up with one of five basic types of investment account: IRAs, which are tax-advantaged accounts used by individuals and married couples to save for retirement. 401(k)s, which are accounts offered by employers that have a similar goal (retirement) and tax advantages as IRAs but relatively higher contribution limits. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), which enjoy triple the tax advantages and can be used for retirement under the right circumstances. Individual (or Joint) Brokerage Accounts, which lack tax advantages but are available to virtually anyone for any investment purpose. 529 plans, which are tax-advantaged accounts that let individuals save for their own or a loved one’s education expenses. Each of these investment accounts is designed with different objectives in mind. Some are more liquid than others, giving you greater flexibility to withdraw money when you need it. Some come with tax advantages. Some have rules and restrictions for when (and how much) you can contribute to them. Or eligibility requirements that determine who can contribute to them. But you don’t have to have an MBA or work in finance to understand the different choices you have. In this guide, we’ll show you how identifying your goal helps narrow your options. Focus first on your investment goal Investment accounts come in many different forms, but you don’t have to learn the intricacies of them all. Before you choose where to put your money, you should have a clear understanding of what you’re trying to do with it. Starting with a financial goal in mind immediately narrows your options and keeps your decision rooted in your desired outcome. Here are some of the most common goals people have when opening an investment account. Planning for retirement When it comes to retirement planning, there are two main types of specialized retirement accounts to consider: IRAs and 401(k)s. HSAs can also be repurposed for retirement with some special considerations, which we’ll preview later. Retirement accounts offer unique tax advantages that can put you in a better position when you retire. However, you’ll usually incur penalties if you withdraw from these accounts before you reach retirement age. With either account type, you can control the ratio of securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) in the account, investment strategy, and more. Within each of these account types, there are also two main kinds to consider: Roth or traditional. First let’s talk about the difference between a 401(k) and an IRA, then we’ll look at Roth vs. traditional options. 401(k) A 401(k) is a retirement plan offered by your employer, also known as an employer-sponsored retirement account. If you invest in a 401(k), your contributions will be automatically deducted from your paycheck. One of the biggest advantages of a 401(k) is that employers will sometimes match a percentage of your contribution as an added benefit of employment, giving you money you wouldn’t otherwise have. If your employer offers to match 401(k) contributions and you don’t take advantage of that, you’re leaving money on the table and choosing to receive fewer benefits than some of your coworkers. 401(k)s also have higher contribution limits than IRAs. Every year, you can legally contribute more than three times as much to a 401(k) as you can into an IRA—up to $20,500 in 2022 if you’re under 50—helping you reach retirement goals sooner. When you leave your employer, you have to decide whether to leave your 401(k) funds with their provider, or roll them over to an IRA or a 401(k) offered by your new employer. Individual Retirement Account (IRA) An IRA works similarly to a 401(k), but your contributions don’t automatically come from your paycheck, and the annual contribution limits are lower ($6,000 if you’re under 50). Since an IRA isn’t offered through your employer, your employer won’t match your contributions to it. If your employer doesn’t offer a 401(k) or doesn’t match your contributions, an IRA can be an excellent choice to start retirement saving. Some investors choose to have both a 401(k) and an IRA to contribute as much as possible toward retirement through tax-advantaged means. The contribution limits are separate, so you can max out a 401(k) and an IRA if you can and are comfortable setting that much money aside every year. Roth vs. traditional The tax advantages of 401(k)s and IRAs come in two flavors: Roth and traditional. Contributions to Roth accounts are made with post-tax dollars, meaning Uncle Sam has already taken a cut. Contributions to traditional accounts, on the other hand, are usually made with pre-tax dollars. These two options effectively determine whether you pay taxes on this money now or later. Here’s another way of looking at it: Say you make $50,000 a year and contribute $5,000 to a Traditional retirement account, your taxable income is $45,000. You’re reaping the tax benefits of your retirement account now—and investing more than you may have been able to otherwise— in exchange for paying taxes on that money later. When you start withdrawing from your account, you’ll generally pay taxes on everything you withdraw, not just your original income. As a side note for high earners, the IRS limits deductions for Traditional IRAs based on income With a Roth account, you pay taxes on your contributions up front– meaning you potentially have less money to invest with–but enjoy the tax advantages later. If you make $50,000 a year and contribute $5,000, your taxable income is still $50,000. The earnings you accrue through a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA are generally tax-free, so when you reach retirement age and start making withdrawals, you don’t have to pay taxes. As a side note for high earners, the IRS limits eligibility for Roth IRAs based on income. So, which is better, Roth or Traditional? The answer depends on how much money you expect to live on during retirement. If you think you’ll be in a higher tax bracket when you retire (because you’ll be withdrawing more than you currently make each month), then paying taxes now with a Roth account can keep more in your pocket. But if you expect to be in the same or lower tax bracket when you retire, then pushing your tax bill down the road via a Traditional retirement account may actually be the better route. Regardless, you should always consult a licensed tax advisor for the best information on your unique circumstances. HSA Designed primarily to help individuals pay for health care costs, HSAs can be an overlooked and underrated investing vehicle. That’s because your HSA contributions, potential earnings, and withdrawals (with a few key stipulations) are tax-free. This is what we mean when we say HSAs enjoy “triple” the tax advantages of IRAs and 401(k)s. In the case of those other two popular investment vehicles, you can catch a tax break on money coming in or going out, but not both. Learn more about how to use your HSA for retirement. Earning more from your savings Some people use investment accounts to simply help maximize the value of their unused income, or to save for major purchases down the road, like a home purchase or car. While a Cash Reserve account can work well for short-term financial goals, a general brokerage account lets you purchase stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds, and other financial assets that come with greater risk and the potential for greater returns. With a brokerage account, you need to decide if you want an individual or joint account. This choice basically comes down to who you want to have control over this account and what you’d like to happen with it when you pass away. It’s common for married couples to use a joint account to consolidate their resources and avoid the hassle of managing multiple accounts. But if you select a joint account, it’s important that you completely trust the other person, as their decisions and even their credit can significantly alter your financial assets. Creditors can sometimes claim funds from a joint investment account, even if the other person hasn’t contributed a dime. While general brokerage accounts offer a lot more flexibility than other investment accounts, they don’t provide tax advantages. If there are account types specialized toward your goal (like how IRAs are built for saving for retirement), they will likely have advantages over a general brokerage account. Saving for your own or a loved one’s education There are a lot of ways to save for education. But if you’re trying to make the most of your money, a 529 plan is an ideal choice because its earnings are tax-free, as long as you use them for qualified education costs. Your 529 plan doesn’t have to sit for a fixed period for you to start using it. As long as it’s applied to education-related expenses (tuition, room and board, books, student loan payments, etc.) for the beneficiary, you can withdraw from the plan as needed. The tax advantages and usage flexibility usually make 529 plans far more suitable for education planning than a simple savings account or a general brokerage account.

      How To Compare Financial Advisors  Think fiduciary first—and don’t settle for surface-level answers to questions on investing philosophy, performance and personalization. In 1 minute “Financial advisor” is kind of a gray area in the professional world. Many different types of professionals share this title, despite having very different qualifications, regulations, and motives. Bottom line: you want a financial advisor who is also a fiduciary. Fiduciaries are legally bound to act in your best interest and disclose conflicts of interest upfront. But even then, it’s worth taking time to learn about their approach to financial advice. What’s their philosophy? What tools do they use to help you reach your goals? How do your goals affect their decisions? Some financial advisors are more accessible than others, too. Ask what you should expect from your interactions with them. How often can you adjust your portfolio? Will they adjust your risk as you get closer to your goal? Every financial advisor should be able to talk you through how they measure performance and what you should expect from them. But don’t settle for surface-level answers. Challenge them to tell you about performance at different levels of risk, using time-weighted returns. Ultimately, you want a financial advisor you can trust to help you reach your goals. In 5 minutes In this guide, we’ll explain: Financial advisor fees Approaches to financial advice Evaluating investment performance Tax advisors You want to make the most of your finances. And you probably have some financial goals you’d like to accomplish. A financial advisor helps with both of these things. But choose the wrong advisor, and you may find yourself going backward, with your goals getting further away. (At the very least, you won’t make as much progress.) Many people focus on historical performance as they compare potential advisors. That‘s understandable. But unless you’re looking at decades of performance data and net investor returns, you’re not getting a good look at what to expect over time. And there are plenty of other factors that affect which advisor is right for you. For starters, let’s talk fees. Take a closer look at their fees Fees can have a major impact on how much money you actually take away. And it’s not just management fees that you need to consider. There could be fees for every trade. Or additional costs for trades within a fund. Plus you’ll want to look at expense ratios—the percentage of your investment that goes toward all the fund’s expenses. These costs can vary widely between robo-advisors, traditional advisors, do-it-yourself ETFs, and mutual funds. And you have to pay them every year. Basically what it comes down to is: how does your financial advisor get paid? Put another way, how will you have to pay for their services? Compare their qualifications Unfortunately, “financial advisor” is a bit of a catch-all term. It describes professionals who may have a variety of certifications and backgrounds. Not everyone who calls themselves a financial advisor has the same regulations, expertise, motivation, or approach. In fact, some aren’t even legally required to act in your best interest! They can choose the investments that benefit them the most instead of the ones that are most likely to help you reach your goals. A fiduciary, however, is a type of financial advisor that’s legally obligated to do two things: Make decisions based on what’s in your best interest Tell you if there’s ever a conflict of interest If you’re going to work with a traditional advisor, you should ask them about their qualifications. At Betterment, we recommend engaging with a fiduciary who is a Certified Financial Planner™ (CFP®), a designation that has requirements for years of experience and continuing education – and has a high standard in quality and ethical financial planning advice. Consider their approach to financial advice and investing There’s more than one school of thought when it comes to investing and financial planning. And there are many different investment vehicles a financial advisor could use to manage your money. So two excellent fiduciaries may have very different ideas of what’s in your best interest. For example, hedge funds work well for some investors, but they’re too risky and expensive for many people. The main thing is to find an advisor whose approach aligns with your goals. How do they ensure that your risk level fits your timeline? How do they diversify your portfolio to help protect your finances? How do they respond to market volatility as prices rise and fall? You want an advisor who makes decisions based on what you’re trying to accomplish, not what’s best for some cookie-cutter investment strategy. It’s also important to learn more about what working with them looks like. How often will you interact? How frequently can you review and modify your account? What ongoing actions do you need to take? The answers to these questions will vary depending on advisor service levels, so make sure they sound realistic to you. For example, Betterment recommends you check-in on your investment allocations once per quarter. If you feel more comfortable with having an in-depth relationship, you can opt for our Premium plan, which offers unlimited calls and emails with our team of CFP® professionals. Evaluate portfolio performance Financial advisors should be transparent about performance. They should have clear explanations for discrepancies between expected and actual returns of an investment. But if you only ask generic questions about what a portfolio returns, the numbers may sound better than they actually are. Ask each financial advisor to walk you through the returns associated with portfolios at various levels of risk. Additionally, consider using time-weighted return statistics when comparing investments. Time-weighted returns aren’t affected by the amount and timing of deposits and withdrawals. The harder an advisor makes it to understand performance (and your net returns), the less likely it is that your investments will meet your expectations. What about tax advisors? A good financial advisor should also be able to structure your investments in a tax-efficient manner. As a few examples, Betterment offers strategies such as tax loss harvesting, HSAs, municipal bonds, Roth IRA conversions, and more. However, there is a distinction between a tax-savvy financial advisor and an actual licensed tax professional. Most financial advisors are not trained or licensed to actually file your taxes for you, or to give advice on all areas of the tax code. For that level of detail, you would be wise to consider working with a true tax professional in addition to your financial advisor. When searching for a tax professional, the designations to look out for include a CPA, Enrolled Agent or a licensed tax attorney. Lastly, your financial advisor and your tax professional should be transparent with one another. You want to ensure both are on the same page and aren’t catching one another by surprise. For example, if your financial advisor is tax loss harvesting for you, it’s probably wise to inform your tax professional about that. Financial expertise you can trust At Betterment, our investing experts and technology help clients build a diversified portfolio that’s right for them, then keep it optimized all year long. To top it all off, we’re a fiduciary—we always focus on your best interest. While our technology combines automation with personalization, you can also get one-on-one advice from our financial experts with an advice package or our Premium plan.

      How To Plan For Retirement  It depends on the lifestyle you want, the investment accounts available, and the income you expect to receive. In 1 minute Retirement planning is personal. It all depends on what you want and what you can do. No matter how far away retirement is, it’s worth thinking through what you want and how you’ll get there. Your retirement account needs to cover your cost of living—whatever that entails. Three of the biggest factors are: How much you want to spend each year Where you want to live When you want to retire Understanding these factors will help you decide how much you need to save. You will also need to decide where to put your money. For many people, retirement savings will live in some combination of these five accounts: Traditional 401(k) Roth 401(k) Traditional IRA Roth IRA Health Savings Account (HSA) 401(k)s are only available through an employer. IRAs are available to anyone. With 401(k)s and IRAs, a Traditional account usually gives you pre-tax benefits, and a Roth account gives you after-tax benefits. The right choice for you depends on whether you think you’ll be in a higher tax bracket now or when you retire. If you’re self-employed, there are some additional retirement accounts to consider, namely: Solo 401(k) SEP IRA SIMPLE IRA These are each suited toward companies of a particular size. A Solo 401(k) has high contribution limits, making it appealing, but it’s only available if you’re the only employee. For businesses with fewer than 100 employees, a SIMPLE IRA may be best, as it allows employees and employers to contribute. You’ll also want to think about supplemental income. If you can expect income beyond what you withdraw from a retirement account, such as social security benefits or a pension, you may not need to save as much. In 5 minutes In this guide, we’ll cover: How much you should save for retirement Choosing retirement accounts Supplemental income to consider Self-employed retirement options Most people want to retire some day. But retirement planning looks a little different for everyone. There’s more than one way to get there. And some people want to live more extravagantly—or frugally—than others. Your retirement plan should be based on the life you want to live and the financial options you have available. And the sooner you sort out the details, the better. Even if retirement seems far away, working out the details now will set you up to retire when and how you want to. First things first: figure out how much you need to save. How much should you save for retirement? How much you need to save ultimately depends on what you want retirement to look like. Some people see themselves traveling the world when they retire. Or living closer to their families. Maybe there’s a hobby you’ve wished you could spend more time and money on. Perhaps for you, retirement looks like the life you have now—just without the job. For many people, that’s a good place to start. Take the amount you spend right now and ask yourself: do you want to spend more or less than that each year of retirement? How long do you want your money to last? Answering these questions will give you a target amount you’ll need to reach and help you think about managing your income in retirement. Don’t forget to think about where you’ll want to live, too. Cost of living varies widely, and it has a big effect on how long your money will last. Move somewhere with a lower cost of living, and you need less to retire. Want to live it up in New York City, Seattle, or San Francisco? Plan to save significantly more. And finally: when do you want to retire? This will give you a target date to save it by (in investing, that’s called a time horizon). It’ll also inform how much you need to retire. Retiring early reduces your time horizon, and increases the number of expected years you need to save for. Still not sure how much to save? Betterment can help you plan for retirement. Choosing retirement accounts Once you know how much you need to save, it’s time to think about where that money will go. Earning interest and taking advantage of tax benefits can help you reach your goal faster, and that’s why choosing the right investment accounts is a key part of retirement planning. While there are many kinds of investment accounts, people usually use five main types to save for retirement. 1. Traditional 401(k) A Traditional 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan. These have two valuable advantages: Your employer may match a percentage of your contributions Your contributions are tax deductible You can only invest in a 401(k) if your employer offers one. If they do, and they match a percentage of your contributions, this is almost always an account you’ll want to take advantage of. The contribution match is free money. You don’t want to leave that on the table. And since your contributions are tax deductible, you’ll pay less income tax while you’re saving for retirement. 2. Roth 401(k) A Roth 401(k) works just like a Traditional one, but with one key difference: the tax advantages come later. You make contributions, your employer (sometimes) matches a percentage of them, and you pay taxes like normal. But when you withdraw your funds during retirement, you don’t pay taxes. This means any interest you earned on your account is tax-free. With both Roth and Traditional 401(k)s, you can contribute a maximum of $20,500 in 2022, or $27,000 if you’re age 50 or over. 3. Traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA) As with a 401(k), an IRA gives you tax advantages. Depending on your income, contributions may lower your pre-tax income, so you pay less income tax leading up to retirement. The biggest difference? Your employer doesn’t match your contributions. The annual contribution limits are also significantly lower: just $6,000 for 2022, or $7,000 if you’re age 50 or over. 4. Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA) A Roth IRA works similarly, but as with a Roth 401(k), the tax benefits come when you retire. Your contributions still count toward your taxable income right now, but when you withdraw in retirement, all your interest is tax-free. So, should you use a Roth or Traditional account? One option is to use both Traditional and Roth accounts for tax diversification during retirement. Another strategy is to compare your current tax bracket to your expected tax bracket during retirement, and try to optimize around that. Also keep in mind that your income may fluctuate throughout your career. So you may choose to do Roth now, but after a significant promotion you might switch to Traditional. 5. Health Savings Account (HSA) An HSA is another solid choice. Contributions to an HSA are tax deductible, and if you use the funds on medical expenses, your distributions are tax-free. After age 65, you can withdraw your funds just like a traditional 401(k) or IRA, even for non-medical expenses. You can only contribute to a Health Savings Accounts if you’re enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). In 2022, you can contribute up to $3,650 to an HSA if your HDHP covers only you, and up to $7,200if your HDHP covers your family. What other income can you expect? Put enough into a retirement account, and your distributions will likely cover your expenses during retirement. But if you can count on other sources of income, you may not need to save as much. For many people, a common source of income during retirement is social security. As long as you or your spouse have made enough social security contributions throughout your career, you should receive social security benefits. Retire a little early, and you’ll still get some benefits (but it may be less). This can amount to thousands of dollars per month. You can estimate the benefits you’ll receive using the Social Security Administration’s Retirement Estimator. Retirement accounts for the self-employed Self-employed people have a few additional options to consider. One Participant 401(k) Plan or Solo 401(k) A Solo 401(k) is similar to a regular 401(k). However, with a Solo 401(k), you’re both the employer and the employee. You can combine the employee contribution limit and the employer contribution limit. As long as you don’t have any employees and you’re your own company, this is a pretty solid option. However, a Solo 401(k) typically requires more advance planning and ongoing paperwork than other account types. If your circumstances change, you may be able to roll over your Solo 401(k) plan or consolidate your IRAs into a more appropriate retirement savings account. Simplified Employee Pension (SEP IRA) With a SEP IRA, the business sets up an IRA for each employee. Only the employer can contribute, and the contribution rate must be the same for each qualifying employee. Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE IRA) A SIMPLE IRA is ideal for small business owners who have 100 employees or less. Both the employer and the employee can contribute. You can also contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA—although how much you can contribute depends on how much you’ve put into other retirement accounts.

      What To Do With An Inheritance Or Major Windfall  You may feel the urge to splurge, but don’t waste this opportunity to move closer to your financial goals. In 10 seconds When an inheritance or major windfall leaves you with more money than usual, you may feel the urge to splurge. But don’t waste this opportunity. Use your extra money on the financial goals you’re already working toward. In 1 minute It’s natural to start thinking about what you could buy when you’re suddenly flush with cash. But before you spend your financial windfall on a big purchase or blow through your inheritance, stop and take a moment to reflect. Think about what else you could do with that money. What is likely to have the most significant impact years down the road? Oh, and don’t forget: you may have some extra taxes coming your way, too. Depending on how big your windfall is and how you got it, you may need to set some of it aside to cover taxes. It’s worth talking to a CPA or tax advisor before you use this money. After that, look at your short- and long-term goals to find the best ways to put your windfall to work. This is an opportunity to accelerate progress on your financial goals. You might be working toward financial security, chipping away at debt, and planning for retirement. Maybe you’re saving for college—for yourself or someone else. Perhaps you want to pay off your mortgage someday. A financial windfall like an inheritance gives you a chance to make major progress toward long-term goals like these. But you’ll also want to think about your emergency fund. How much have you saved? How long will it last with your current expenses? Is it enough? It might be time to start estate planning, too. This helps ensure that if something terrible happens to you, more of your wealth goes toward the people and purposes you want it to. Bottom line: create a financial plan, or stick to the one you have. In 5 minutes In this guide, we’ll cover: Why it’s so easy to waste a windfall Why taxes should always come first What to do with the rest of your windfall It’s hard to be rational when thousands of dollars appear in your bank account, or you’re staring at a massive check. You might be excitedly thinking about what to buy with a tax refund. Or mourning the loss of a loved one who left you an inheritance. Whether you were expecting this windfall or not, it’s important to slow down and think about the best way to use it. Many people let their impulses get the better of them. But used wisely, every windfall is a chance to give your financial plan a boost. Why it’s so easy to waste a windfall We tend to treat windfalls like inheritances differently than we treat other money. Many of us naturally think of it like a “bonus,” so saving may not even cross our mind. And even if you’ve worked hard to develop healthy spending habits, a sudden windfall can undo your effort. Here’s how it can happen: An inheritance makes your cash balance spike. You spend a little on early splurges, and start to slack on saving habits. This behavior snowballs, and a few months or years later, you face two consequences: you’ve completely spent the inheritance, and you’ve lost the good fiscal habits you had before. You can also fall into the trap of overextending your finances after using an inheritance for a big purchase. Say you use the inheritance for a down payment on a bigger house. Along with a bigger house comes higher property taxes, home maintenance costs, homeowner’s insurance, and monthly utilities. New furniture, too. Your monthly expenses can expand quickly while your income stays the same. The moment you find yourself with a lot of extra money, think about taxes. Why taxes should always come first You don’t want to spend money you don’t have. If you burn through your windfall without setting aside money for taxes, that’s exactly what you could be doing. You’re not going to pay taxes on a tax refund, but if you receive an inheritance, win the lottery, sell a property, or find yourself in another unique situation, you could owe some hefty taxes. The best thing to do is consult a certified public accountant (CPA) or tax advisor to determine if you owe taxes on your windfall. What to do with the rest of your windfall Once taxes are taken care of, look at your windfall as an opportunity to accelerate your financial goals. Remember, if you created a financial plan, you already thought about the purchases and milestones that will be most meaningful to you. Sure, plans can change, but many of your responsibilities and long-term goals will stay the same. Still stuck? Here are some high-impact financial goals you can make serious progress on in the event of a windfall. Pay down your debt Left unchecked, high-interest debt can often outpace your financial gains. Credit card debt is especially dangerous. And while your student loan debt may have low interest rates, paying it off early could save you thousands of dollars. Paying off debt doesn’t have to mean you can’t work toward other financial goals—the important thing is to consider how fast your debt will accrue interest, and make paying it off one of your top priorities. Depending on the size of your windfall, you could snap your fingers and make your debt disappear. Boost your retirement fund It’s not always fun to plan years into the future, but putting some of your windfall to work in your retirement fund could make life a lot easier down the road. Put enough into retirement savings, and you may even be able to adjust your retirement plan. Maybe you could think about retiring earlier, or giving yourself more money to spend each year of retirement. Here’s more on planning your retirement. Refinance your mortgage Paying off your primary mortgage isn’t usually a top priority . . . but refinancing can be a smart move. If you’re paying mortgage insurance and your equity has gone up enough, refinancing might mean you can stop. And locking in a lower interest rate can save tens of thousands of dollars over the life of your mortgage. Taking this step means your goal of home ownership may interfere less with your other financial goals. Revisit your safety net Any time your cost of living or responsibilities change, your emergency fund needs to keep up. Whatever stage of life you’re in, you want to be confident you have the finances to stay afloat in a crisis. If you suddenly lost your job or couldn’t work, do you have enough set aside to maintain your current lifestyle for at least a few months? Start estate planning Wherever you’re at in life, it’s important to consider what would happen if you suddenly died or became incapacitated. What would happen to you, your loved ones, and your assets? Would your finances make it into the right hands? Would they be used in the right ways? When you find yourself with a major windfall, it’s a good time to create or reevaluate your estate plan. Take time to double-check that you’ve set beneficiaries for all of your investment accounts. If you haven’t already, create a will and appoint a power of attorney. If you have children, you may want to set up a trust. Estate planning isn’t fun, but it can start paying immediate dividends in the form of peace of mind. Give your financial goals a boost It’s normal to want to spend your inheritance. It feels like extra cash, just waiting to be spent on a big purchase. But if you resist the temptation, your financial windfall could be an incredible opportunity to reach new milestones and achieve goals that matter to you. Not sure where to start?

      What Is A Fiduciary, And Do I Need One for My Investments?  When it comes to getting help managing your financial life, transparency is the name of the game. In 10 seconds A fiduciary is a person or institution that is legally required to act in your best interest when managing your finances. Working with a fiduciary helps ensure that the financial advice you receive is transparent. In 1 minute A fiduciary is legally obligated to put your financial interests ahead of their own. They have a duty to eliminate or disclose potential conflicts of interest whenever possible. Betterment holds itself to this high standard, which in turn gives our customers peace of mind. Non-fiduciary advisors, on the other hand, can legally prioritize investments that pad their own pockets more than yours. A common conflict of interest involves commissions. Many investment professionals primarily rely on commissions to make money. They can be motivated to have you invest in assets that give them the biggest commissions, rather than what will provide the most expected benefit to you. If you want to try and ensure the financial advice you receive is transparent, consider working with a fiduciary. In 5 minutes In this guide we’ll: Define what a fiduciary is Explain how they differ from other financial advisors Consider when it can be important to work with a fiduciary Learn how to be a proactive investment shopper What is a fiduciary? When you seek out financial advice, it’s reasonable to assume your advisor would put your best interests ahead of their own. But the truth is, if the investment advisor isn’t a fiduciary, they aren’t actually required to do so. A fiduciary is a professional or institution that has the power to act on behalf of another party, and is required to do what is in the best interest of the other party to preserve good faith and trust. What is the fiduciary duty? An investment advisor with a fiduciary duty to its clients is obligated to follow both a duty of care and a duty of loyalty to their clients. The duty of care requires a fiduciary to act in the client’s best interest. Under the duty of loyalty, the fiduciary must also attempt to eliminate or disclose all potential conflicts of interest. Not all advisors are held to the same standards when providing advice, so it’s important to know who is required to act as a fiduciary. Are all financial advisors fiduciaries? Short answer: No. Financial advisors not acting as fiduciaries operate under a looser guideline called the suitability standard. Advisors who operate under a suitability standard have to choose investments that are appropriate based on the client’s circumstances, but they neither have to put the clients’ best interests first nor disclose or avoid conflicts of interest so long as the transaction is considered suitable. What are examples of conflicts of interest? When in doubt, just follow the money. How do your financial advisors get paid? Are they incentivised to take actions that might not be in your best interest. Commissions are one of the most common conflicts of interest. At large brokerages, it’s still not uncommon for investment professionals to primarily rely on commissions to make money. With commission-based pay, your advisor might receive a cut each time you trade, plus a percentage each time they steer your money into certain investment companies’ financial products. They can be motivated to recommend you invest in funds that pay them high commissions (and cost you a higher fee), even if there’s a comparable and cheaper fund that benefits your financial strategy as a client. When is it important to work with a fiduciary? When looking for an advisor to trade on your behalf and make investment decisions for you, you should strongly consider choosing a fiduciary advisor. This should help ensure that you receive suitable recommendations that will also be in your best interest. If you want to entrust an advisor with your financials and give them discretion, you may want to make sure they’re legally required to put your interests ahead of their own. On the other hand, if you’re simply seeking help trading securities in your portfolio, or you don’t want to give an advisor discretion over your accounts, you may not need a fiduciary advisor. How to be a proactive investment shopper Hiring a fiduciary advisor to manage your portfolio is one of the best ways to try and ensure you are receiving unbiased advice. We highly recommend verifying that your professional is getting paid to meet your needs, not the needs of a broker, fund, or external portfolio strategy. Ask the tough questions: “I’d love to learn how you’re paid in this arrangement. How do you make money?” “How do you protect your clients from your own biases? Can you tell me about potential conflicts of interest in this arrangement?” “What’s the philosophy behind the advice you give? What are the aspects of investment management that you focus on most?” “What would you say is your point of differentiation from other advisors?" Some of these questions may be answered in a Form CRS, which is a relationship summary that advisors and brokers are required to give their clients or customers as of summer 2020. You should also know the costs of your current investments and compare them with other options in the marketplace as time goes on. If alternatives seem more attractive, ask your advisor why they haven’t suggested making a switch. And if the explanation you get seems inadequate, consider whether you should continue working with your investment professional. Why is Betterment a fiduciary? A common point of confusion is whether or not robo-advisors can be fiduciaries. So let’s clear up any ambiguities: Yes, they certainly can be.

      How To Manage Your Income In Retirement  An income strategy during retirement can help make your portfolio last longer, while also easing potential tax burdens. In 10 seconds How you manage your retirement income can have a significant impact on how long your savings last. Adjust your asset allocation over time and withdraw from your accounts in the right order to help stretch your money further. In 1 minute Retirement planning doesn’t end when you retire. To have the retirement you’ve been dreaming of, you need to ensure your savings will last. And how much you withdraw each month isn’t all that matters. If you’re not careful, market downswings can dramatically lower the value of your portfolio—and once you start making withdrawals, it’s much harder to rebound with the market. It’s important to prepare for the risk. As retirement draws nearer, you should consider adjusting your asset allocation to take on less risk. During retirement, you may gradually shift to an allocation of just 30% stocks, with the remainder going toward less volatile assets, like bonds. As you make withdrawals and earn dividends, you’ll likely want to rebalance your portfolio, either manually or through automated services like those at Betterment, based on the market and your target allocation. Even though you're retired, a financial safety net is still essential. You should strongly consider maintaining enough funds for three to six months of expenses in a low-risk, accessible account, so if things take a turn for the worse, you have something to fall back on. Supplemental income helps, too. Social Security, rental income, a part-time job, or pension withdrawals can help you maintain your lifestyle in retirement and leave more of your nest egg in growth mode. It’s also a good idea to withdraw from your accounts in the right order. Generally you should consider starting with taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and save the tax-free accounts for last. One exception is when you have Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs). In that case, you can withdraw your RMDs first, then take anything else you need from your taxable accounts, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts. Another exception is when your tax bracket is higher/lower than usual. Sound complicated? Betterment can help you decide exactly how much to withdraw based on your timeline and portfolio. In 5 minutes In this guide we’ll cover: Why changes in the market affect you differently in retirement How to keep bad timing from ruining your retirement How to decide which accounts to withdraw from first Part of retirement planning involves thinking about your retirement budget. But whether you’re already retired or you’re simply thinking ahead, it’s also important to think about how you’ll manage your income in retirement. Retirement is a huge milestone. And reaching it changes how you have to think about taxes, your investments, and your income. For starters, changes in the market can seriously affect how long your money lasts. Why changes in the market affect you differently in retirement Stock markets can swing up or down at any time. They’re volatile. When you’re saving for a distant retirement, you usually don’t have to worry as much about temporary dips. But during retirement, market volatility can have a dramatic effect on your savings. An investment account is a collection of individual assets. When you make a withdrawal from your retirement account, you’re selling off assets to equal the amount you want to withdraw. So say the market is going through a temporary dip. Since you’re retired, you have to continue making withdrawals in order to maintain your income. During the dip, your investment assets may have less value, so you have to sell more of them to equal the same amount of money. When the market goes back up, you have fewer assets that benefit from the rebound. The opposite is true, too. When the market is up, you don’t have to sell as many of your assets to maintain your income. There will always be good years and bad years in the market. How your withdrawals line up with the market’s volatility is called the “sequence of returns.” Unfortunately, you can’t control it. In many ways, it’s the luck of the withdrawal. Still, there are ways to decrease the potential impact of a bad sequence of returns. How to keep bad timing from ruining your retirement The last thing you want is to retire and then lose your savings to market volatility. So you’ll want to take some steps to try and protect your retirement from a bad sequence of returns. Adjust your level of risk As you near or enter retirement, it’s likely time to start cranking down your stock-to-bond allocation. Invest too heavily in stocks, and your retirement savings could tank right when you need them. Betterment generally recommends turning down your ratio to about 56% stocks in early retirement, then gradually decreasing to about 30% toward the end of retirement. Rebalance your portfolio During retirement, the two most common cash flows in/out of your investment accounts will likely be dividends you earn and withdrawals you make. If you’re strategic, you can use these cash flows as opportunities to rebalance your portfolio. For example, if stocks are down at the moment, you likely want to withdraw from your bonds instead. This can help prevent you from selling stocks at a loss. Alternatively, if stocks are rallying, you may want to reinvest your dividends into bonds (instead of cashing them out) in order to bring your portfolio back into balance with your preferred ratio of stocks to bonds. Keep a safety net Even in retirement, it’s important to have an emergency fund. If you keep a separate, low-risk account in your portfolio with enough money to cover three to six months of expenses, you can likely cushion—or ride out altogether—the blow of a bad sequence of returns. Supplement your income Hopefully, you’ll have enough retirement savings to produce a steady income from withdrawals. But it’s nice to have other income sources, too, to minimize your reliance on investment withdrawals in the first place. Social Security might be enough—although a pandemic or other disaster can deplete these funds faster than expected. Maybe you have a pension you can withdraw from, too. Or a part-time job. Or rental properties. Along with the other precautions above, these additional income sources can help counter bad returns early in retirement. While you can’t control your sequence of returns, you can control the order you withdraw from your accounts. And that’s important, too. How to decide which accounts to withdraw from first In retirement, taxes are usually one of your biggest expenses. They’re right up there with healthcare costs. When it comes to your retirement savings, there are three “tax pools” your accounts can fall under: Taxable accounts: individual accounts, joint accounts, and trusts Tax-deferred accounts: individual retirement accounts (IRAs), 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and Thrift Savings Plans Tax-free accounts: Roth IRAs, Roth 401(k)s Each of these account types (taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free) are taxed differently—and that’s important to understand when you start making withdrawals. Here’s how taxes work with each of these account types. When you have funds in all three tax pools, this is known as “tax diversification.” This strategy can create some unique opportunities for managing your retirement income. Withdrawing from your taxable accounts first usually gives your portfolio more time to grow. This is because you only pay taxes on the capital gains, so more money stays in your account. With a tax-deferred account like a 401(k), you pay taxes on the full amount you withdraw, so with each withdrawal, taxes take more away from your portfolio’s future earning potential. Since you don’t have to pay taxes on withdrawals from your tax-free accounts, it’s typically best to save these for last. You want as much tax-free money as possible, right? So the ideal withdrawal order is generally: Taxable accounts Tax-deferred accounts Tax-free accounts But in abnormal years, where you find your tax bracket either higher or lower than usual, you likely will want to deviate from this strategy, and attempt to “smooth” out your tax bracket. This is more advanced, but can help you take advantage of lower tax years and minimize the impact of higher tax years. There’s just one other thing to consider: Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs). When you reach a certain age, you’re required to take a certain amount from your tax-deferred accounts each month—or else you’ll lose 50% of the required amount. If that applies to you, you’ll want to take out your RMD first, then follow the order above. So it goes: Required Minimum Distributions, taxable accounts, tax-deferred accounts, tax-free accounts. Withdraw your retirement income from your accounts in that order, and you’ll likely help your savings last as long as possible. Take the guesswork out of your retirement income Sometimes it’s hard to decide how much to withdraw from your retirement savings. And as you enjoy years of retirement, when and how should you adjust your asset allocation? Betterment helps you with both of these decisions. As a Betterment investor, when you designate yourself a retiree, you can set up a goal called “Retirement Income.” Our algorithm will automatically calculate a safe withdrawal amount and recommend an asset allocation based on where you’re at and what you have to work with. You can set up automatic withdrawals from your Betterment account to your checking account, helping you maintain a personalized payment schedule. Ready to get started?

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Financing An Education: A Guide For Students And Parents  Learn more about two common vehicles: 529 plans and student loans In 1 minute There’s more than one way to finance your education. A 529 plan is like a retirement account—but for education. It comes with tax benefits and can grow over time. Just keep in mind that each state has its own 529 plan, and the investment choices, rules and benefits vary. Some states match whatever you put into the account, or let you pay for tuition credits now (with today’s prices). Performance, contribution limits, and usage rules can also vary from plan to plan. You’re not limited to the 529 plan offered by your state. So don’t assume your state’s plan is right for you. As you compare plans, focus on tax benefits, fees, and investment choices. You can also pay for school with student loans. Most students have to take out at least some loans to fund their education. As long as you choose your loans wisely and have a strategy for paying them off, borrowing can make sense. You may not even have to repay all of your loans if you qualify for loan forgiveness after you graduate. And if you need to, you can usually consolidate or refinance your loans to make repayment simpler or lower your interest rate. Whether by borrowing, saving, or some combination of the two, an early emphasis on how to fund your studies helps set you up for academic success once class is in session. In 5 minutes In this guide, we’ll cover: Investing in a 529 plan Financing responsibly with student loans Whether you’re looking at university or trade school, education is expensive. And if you’re like most people, you probably don’t have that kind of cash on hand. Some manage to work their way through college, but depending on the school, even a full-time job will barely put a dent in your expenses.&nbsp; So how should you pay for school? The answer depends on how much time you have, where you live, and where you want to go. If you have money to set aside for school, a 529 plan might be your best bet. Student loans are always an option, too—you just have to be careful. What’s a 529 plan? How do you choose one? A 529 plan is a specialized investment account with tax benefits. It works similarly to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k). You put money into the account and pay taxes up front, and if you withdraw for education expenses, you usually don’t have to pay taxes on anything you earned. While IRAs and 401(k)s help you plan for retirement, 529 plans help you plan for education expenses. Oh, and every state has its own plan. There are two types of 529 plans: Prepaid tuition plans Education savings plans Prepaid tuition plans With a prepaid tuition plan, you pay for tuition credits upfront, using today’s tuition rates. These plans are not very popular, and most states don’t offer these plans anymore, but since tuition costs are always increasing, this can be a good option. Who knows how much tuition will cost in the coming years! The downside is that this money can only be used for tuition, and there are plenty of other education expenses. Education savings plans An education savings plan is more like a traditional investment account. You invest in funds, stocks, bonds, and other financial assets, and your account has the potential to grow through compound interest. You can also use this money on more than just tuition. Depending on your state, you could use your account for education fees, living expenses, technology, school supplies, or even student loan payments. Use it on anything else, and there’s a 10% penalty. 529 plan limitations Every 529 plan needs a specific beneficiary. It could be yourself, your child, a grandkid, a friend—whoever. Their age doesn’t matter. The only limitations are what the funds can be used for and how much you can contribute. Everything you put into a 529 plan is considered “a gift” to the beneficiary. And there are limits to how much you can gift to a person each year before being subject to gift tax rules. But you also have a lifetime limit in the millions of dollars. After that, there’s a gift tax. Gift tax rules are complex, so we recommend consulting a tax professional. Every state is different 529 plans can vary widely from state-to-state. And since you can choose plans from other states, it’s worth shopping around. While some plans let you apply your account to in-state or out-of-state education, others don’t. If you’re looking at a plan you can only use in-state, make sure you’re comfortable with the available schools.&nbsp; Some states offer a match program, where they’ll match a percentage of 529 plan contributions from low- and middle-income families. This could substantially boost your savings. Your state might also offer a full or partial tax break on your contributions—but that usually only applies if you live in state. And of course, each 529 plan is an investment account, so you’ll also want to review the investment choices and consider the cost of fees. For every plan, the account’s total worth can only be equal to the “expected amount” of future education expenses for each beneficiary. But that’s going to vary widely from state to state. The exact limit depends on which 529 plan you choose, but it’s typically a few hundred thousand dollars for each beneficiary. If you’re wanting to save for a private college or grad program, that may not be enough. And if your state’s limit is lower than what you think you’ll need, that may offset the benefit of a state tax break or match program. And according to Federal law, you can use up to $10,000 from a 529 plan to pay for “enrollment or attendance at an eligible elementary or secondary school.” It also lets you apply $10,000 toward student loans. But some states don’t follow these federal laws. If they don’t, and you use your funds like this anyway, you’ll have to pay a 10% penalty. Bottom line: do your research, and make sure you’re familiar with the specifics of your 529 plan. How to choose a 529 plan The best 529 plan for you depends on: Where you live Where you or your beneficiary will go to school How much you want to save What you want to spend this money on But if you’re wondering how to tell which plan is likely to make the most of your money, it really comes down to just three things: tax benefits, fees, and investment choices. Be sure to look at all plan details and compare these factors before choosing one. Student loan basics Student loans have a bad reputation. And it’s understandable. About 43 million Americans owe an average of $39,000 in student loans. The average student needs to borrow about $30,000 to earn their bachelor’s degree. But when it comes down to it, if you don’t have money to contribute to a 529 plan or investment account (or your account doesn’t have enough money), your options are: Work your way through college Take out student loans Even with a job, you may need to take student loans. Used wisely (and sparingly), student loans don’t have to consume your finances or derail your other goals. But as with 529 plans, you can’t assume every loan is the same. Types of student loans There are two main types of student loans to consider: Federal Private Federal student loans often (but not always) have the lowest interest rates, don’t require credit checks, and come with benefits like pathways to loan forgiveness. You don’t need a cosigner to get most federal loans, and nearly all students with a high school diploma or GED are eligible for them. However, there’s a cap on how much money you can take out in federal loans, and some types of federal loans require you to demonstrate financial need. Financial institutions like banks can also provide private student loans. These typically require a good credit score, and you can take out as much as you need (as long as you’re approved for it).&nbsp; Another big difference: with private loans, you typically start making payments immediately and have a fixed repayment schedule set by your lender. With federal loans, you may not have to pay while you’re in school, you get a six-month grace period after you graduate, and you can choose from four repayment plans. Federal loan repayment options Federal loans give you flexibility with repayment. If you’re struggling to make monthly payments, you can choose one of four Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans that may work better for your situation. Each of these plans allows for payments based on your income, usually 10-20% of it with a few exceptions, which makes individual payments more manageable. Unfortunately, this usually also means you’ll be making payments for longer. Check out the Federal Student Loan website for more detailed information on each plan. If you want to pay off your loans faster, you can also select a Graduated Repayment Plan, which increases your payments periodically, ensuring you pay off your loans in 10 years. There’s also another way to ditch your federal loan payments ahead of schedule: loan forgiveness. Student loan forgiveness With federal loans, there are two pathways to loan forgiveness: Public service Income-Driven Repayment Go into the right line of work after college, and you could be eligible for Public Student Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). This is available to students who pursue careers with nonprofits, government agencies, and some public sectors. If you make monthly qualifying payments for 10 years, then you can apply for forgiveness. If you don’t qualify for PSLF, but you’re on an IDR plan, you have another potential pathway to forgiveness. After 20-25 years of monthly payments, you may qualify for forgiveness, too. Unfortunately, on this path, you have to pay income taxes on the amount that was forgiven. (This is referred to as a “tax bomb.”) Consolidating and refinancing student loans Sometimes it’s tough to juggle multiple repayment schedules, interest rates, and payment amounts. If you’re having a hard time keeping track of your student loans, you may want to consider consolidating them so you have one monthly payment. Consolidating through a private institution could also give you a new interest rate (the average of your old ones) and let you adjust your payment time horizon. The federal consolidation program won’t change your interest rate, but it will still group your loans into a single payment for you. Whatever loans you wind up with and whatever your repayment plan, make sure you stay on top of your minimum payments. Fees and penalties can significantly increase your debt over time.

      How To Use Your Health Savings Account (HSA) For Retirement  Once you turn 65, you can use them for anything you want—without incurring penalties. In 1 minute Like IRAs and 401(k)s, health savings accounts provide tax benefits. Your contributions to an HSA are tax-free, and if you use this money to cover qualified medical costs, your withdrawals are tax-free, too. With the right HSA, you can even invest these funds and earn interest on your contributions. Unfortunately, there’s a couple of catches. You can read more detail here, but the key highlights are below. For starters, you’re only eligible to contribute to an HSA if you’re currently enrolled in a high deductible health plan (HDHP) and meet a few other conditions: You are not enrolled in Medicare You are not someone else’s dependent You do not have other health coverage And just as importantly, if you use HSA funds on unqualified expenses before you turn 65, there’s a steep 20% penalty. Many people should expect to have more medical costs during retirement, and since withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax-free, it’s usually best to delay using your HSA until retirement. And since the penalty disappears after 65, HSAs can be a great tool to save for general retirement, too. Especially if you’re already maxing out your contributions to other retirement accounts! If you’re thinking about switching health plans to open an HSA, make sure you consider whether an HDHP is right for you and your family. Your HSA won’t help you plan for retirement if you have to use it all on medical expenses each year. That’s why it’s usually smart to have a fully-funded emergency fund before or soon after signing up for an HDHP. You’ll also want to choose an HSA with investment options that fit your goals. Decades away from retirement? An HSA that only lets you invest in short-term money market funds probably isn’t ideal. As long as the health plan is a good fit and you find the right opportunity, an HSA can be a smart investment in your future. In 5 minutes In this guide, we’ll cover: HSA eligibility The benefits of HSAs HSA withdrawal rules Using an HSA for retirement Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are designed to cover future medical expenses. But that’s not the only way to use them. Thanks to their tax benefits and withdrawal rules, HSAs can make a valuable addition to your retirement plan. As long as you’re eligible, you can make tax-deductible contributions to an HSA. The balance on this account rolls over every year, so there’s no pressure to “use it or lose it.” But you can’t just dump all your extra money into an HSA to avoid taxes, either. Your contribution limit depends on your age and who your health plan covers. If you’re 55 or over, you can make additional “catch-up” contributions. And if your family is covered by your health plan, it effectively doubles your limit. HSA Contribution Limits &nbsp; Contribution Limits Catch-up Contribution Limits (for individuals 55 and above) HSA 2021 2022 2021 2022 Self-only coverage $3,600 $3,650 $1,000 $1,000 Family coverage $7,200 $7,300 $1,000 $1,000 Want to take advantage of an HSA? First you need to find out if you’re eligible. Am I eligible for an HSA? To be eligible for an HSA, you have to: Be covered under a high deductible health plan (HDHP). Not be enrolled in Medicare. Not be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return. Have no other health coverage except what the IRS covers under “Other Employee Health Plans”. Your employer may have information on HSA providers available to you. The expanded IRS rules can provide more detailed eligibility information. What are the benefits of an HSA? Health Savings Accounts have a couple tax benefits that help you make the most of your assets. Your contributions are pre-tax, meaning you can deduct them from your income taxes. You can use these funds at any time to pay for qualified medical expenses without paying taxes or penalties. And when you turn 65, you can use your HSA for anything without incurring a penalty. While you must have a high deductible health plan in order to contribute to your HSA, your HSA isn’t tied to a specific employer. It stays with you when you change jobs or retire. The money doesn’t leave the account until you use it. Also, your employer may contribute to your HSA—and since the contribution is pre-tax, it doesn’t count toward your gross income. Some HSAs are specialized savings accounts. But some are actually investment accounts. Any interest and earnings that come from these HSAs are tax-free provided you don’t use them on unqualified expenses before you turn 65. So HSAs can rank amongst the best ways to save for retirement, on par with some 401(k)s and IRAs depending on factors such as an employer match, fees, and/or investment choices. HSA withdrawal rules Need some money to cover unexpected medical costs? Make a tax-free withdrawal. Don’t need it? Save it for your retirement. Withdrawing from an HSA for non-medical expenses comes with a 20% penalty . . . unless you’re over 65. Once you turn 65, withdrawals from an HSA work a lot like withdrawals from a traditional IRA or 401(k). Your withdrawals count toward your annual income, so you’ll pay income taxes based on your tax bracket. However, if you use your withdrawal to pay for medical expenses, it’s still tax-free. Basically, there are three possible outcomes when you withdraw from an HSA—and it all comes down to your age and what you use the money for. Your age Qualified Medical Expenses Other Expenses Less than 65 years old No taxes, no penalty Taxes are applicable, 20% penalty 65 years old or older Taxes are applicable, no penalty How to use your Health Savings Account for retirement When you reach retirement age, medical bills can start to add up quickly. Use your HSA to cover these expenses, and you’re triple-dipping on the tax benefits! Your contributions are tax free, your interest and earnings are tax free, and so are your withdrawals. From a financial planning perspective, that’s hard to beat. And it can make expenses like long-term care a lot less frightening. But an HSA is also a great supplement to your IRA or 401(k). Since the 20% penalty disappears when you turn 65, you won’t have to worry about whether an expense is qualified—just use your money as you see fit. Before you choose an HSA ... An HSA is like a financial Swiss Army Knife. But while it’s highly versatile, it’s not the right choice for everyone. So, before you switch health plans and open an HSA, there are a few things to consider. Know the fees When it comes to fees and other costs, HSAs are often less transparent than accounts like 401(k)s. Look at the full fee schedule for your HSA before contributing. Also, sometimes your employer will cover all, or a portion, of your fees—so find out about that, too. Explore the investment options Ideally, you want an HSA with investment options that fit your goals. Some providers only allow investments with low risk and low returns, like money market funds. Other HSAs offer multiple mutual fund listings with higher returns and more risk exposure. Some HSAs have minimums before you can start investing. For example, you might only be able to invest your money once you’ve contributed $1,000 to the HSA. Stay current on withdrawal rules Withdrawal rules around taxes and penalties can change with new regulations, so it’s important to stay up-to-date with any new changes that take place. Don’t just switch to an HDHP A high-deductible health plan isn’t right for everyone. Before switching to an HDHP so you can use an HSA to save for retirement, make sure that works for you and your family. A high-deductible health plan brings with it the potential for higher out-of-pocket medical costs.

      Save Taxes When Withdrawing in Retirement  A smart withdrawal strategy during retirement can help make your portfolio last longer, while also easing potential tax burdens. When you retire, you can no longer count on a paycheck to fund your lifestyle. Though you may have some sources of fixed income, such as from Social Security or defined benefit pension plans, the income from these sources may not be enough to cover all of your regular expenses. That can leave you relying on the money from your investment portfolio to maintain your expenses and lifestyle. As a smart investor, you probably already have an idea of how much money you can safely spend during each year of retirement. But still, one important question remains: In which order should you withdraw from your accounts? While the true answer to this question depends largely on your individual circumstances, your actions can have a huge impact on both your tax bill and the longevity of your portfolio. Taxes will likely be one of your largest expenses in retirement (on par with healthcare), so a smart withdrawal strategy is crucial to your retirement success. Luckily, you often have more control over your taxes in retirement than at any other point in your life. While there are common strategies to follow, there are other more advanced strategies that could lead to substantial tax savings. At Betterment, we’ve established some guidelines to not only help build a smart retirement income plan, but to also try to save on taxes by establishing an order in which you should withdraw from your various investment accounts in retirement. But first, let’s examine how your money is taxed when withdrawn in retirement. How Withdrawals Are Taxed Before creating your retirement income strategy, you must first understand how withdrawals from your various accounts are taxed. We’ll explain the typical tax consequences by taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts. Taxable Accounts (individual, joint, and trusts): Investment income, such as dividends or interest income, is generally taxed in the year it is received. Any withdrawals are subject to capital gains tax, but only on the growth of the investment—not the principle. Tax-Deferred Accounts (Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and Thrift Savings Plans): Unlike taxable accounts, no taxes are due on investment income or growth—until you make a withdrawal. When you do take money out, that full amount is subject to ordinary income tax. You are essentially delaying the payment of taxes. Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRAs or Roth 401(k) plans): All investment income, growth, and withdrawals are tax-free, if meeting the requirements for a qualified distribution. Taxes on Withdrawals Vary By Account Type As you can see, pulling money from each of these account types (taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free) can have very different tax consequences. &nbsp; A Withdrawal Strategy for Tax Efficiency The ideal order for withdrawing money from your various accounts during retirement is as follows: First, pull money from your taxable accounts. Once those accounts are depleted, begin withdrawing money from tax-deferred accounts. Lastly, take money out of tax-free accounts. The reason that this strategy is generally most tax-efficient is the power of tax deferral and the compound growth that it provides. The longer you can shelter your tax-deferred and tax-free accounts, the better. That means more money stays in your accounts and can grow over time. Let’s look at how this order of operations works in more detail. Example: Why You Should Withdraw From Taxable Accounts First If you decide to withdraw money from your Traditional 401(k), every dollar will be taxed as ordinary income, which is the highest tax rate to which you could be subjected. In this hypothetical example, let’s say you need $1,000 and you are in the 24% marginal tax bracket. To end up with a net of $1,000, you would actually have to withdraw $1,316, because of the additional tax liability: $1,316 (amount withdrawn) x 24% (marginal tax bracket) = $316 (taxes owed) However, if instead you first pull money out from your taxable individual account, two things happen. First, as long as the money has been invested for over one year, the tax rate on your sold assets is lower. Long-term capital gains taxes are generally 15%.1 Second, you don’t pay taxes on the full withdrawal, only on the growth. If you bought the investment for $600, you only have to withdraw $1,071 to end up with a net of $1,000: $1,071 (amount withdrawn) – $600 (your basis) = $471 (capital gain) x 15% = $71 (taxes owed) A $1,316 withdrawal versus a $1,071 withdrawal results in a difference of $245 that gets to stay invested and potentially grow for a longer period of time. The benefit of tax deferral is clear. With Roth accounts, it gets even better. Money inside a Roth will never be taxed again if you meet the qualified distribution rules, so you keep 100% of all growth or income you earn. This is why tax-free accounts should generally be the last accounts you touch. Incorporating Minimum Distributions Generally, once you reach age 72, you must begin taking Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from your tax-deferred (non-Roth IRA) accounts. Not doing so will result in a 50% penalty on the amount you were supposed to take. This changes things—but only slightly. At this point, you’d want to follow these new steps: First, withdraw your RMDs. If you still need more, then you can pull from taxable accounts. Once depleted, start withdrawing from your tax-deferred accounts. Lastly, pull money from tax-free accounts. Supercharge Your Withdrawal Strategy You’ve seen the power of tax deferral, but if you’re a Betterment customer, there are other ways in which we help make your retirement income plan even more effective. Specific Lot Selection: When you make a withdrawal, we automatically sell investments that are at a loss first, which helps minimize your current tax hit. Account Specific Asset Allocation: We put tax-efficient asset classes (such as municipal bonds) in your taxable accounts, rather than in your tax-sheltered accounts. Both of these strategies seek to further optimize your tax withdrawal strategies. We execute on these tactics for you so that you can keep more money inside your accounts where it is able to grow. The Problem of Roller Coaster Income Unfortunately, putting a plan into action is always more complicated than in theory. In retirement, you will likely have multiple sources of non-investment income coming from Social Security, defined benefit pensions, rental income, part-time work, and/or RMDs. However, these fixed income streams do not all begin or end at the same time, and some can vary from year to year, just as a roller coaster goes up and down. This can cause your tax bracket and your spending needs to fluctuate throughout retirement, adding a layer of complexity to your retirement income plan. At first glance, these fluctuations seem to make creating a retirement income plan more difficult. Does the recommended strategy stated above, then, still apply? In most cases, yes. And with a little extra planning, you may actually be able to use these swings to your advantage. Smooth Out Bumps in Your Tax Bracket For most years, Betterment recommends pulling from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and tax-free accounts last. However, you should look for abnormal years of high and low income fluctuations and their associated tax brackets, then plan accordingly. By temporarily altering the above strategy, you can “smooth” out your tax bracket throughout retirement and reduce taxes. Lower Income, Lower Tax Bracket Some years you may find yourself in a lower bracket than usual. During these years, it may make sense to fill these low brackets with withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts before touching your taxable accounts, and possibly consider Roth conversions. Common examples of low-bracket years may occur when: You retire before you plan on claiming Social Security benefits. You have large balances in your IRA/traditional 401(k) that will cause future RMDs to bump you into higher brackets. Higher Income, Higher Tax Bracket On the other hand, you may have years where you are in an abnormally high tax bracket. In this case, it may make sense to pull from tax-free accounts first to minimize the effect of higher tax rates. Remember, higher taxes mean larger withdrawals and less money staying invested. Common examples of high-bracket years occur when: You sell a home or rental property and end up with large capital gains. You are working part-time in retirement and have a good year financially. You lose a large deduction, for example, perhaps you pay off your mortgage. Federal Income Tax Brackets (2022) Tax Rate Single Married 10% $0 – $10,275 $0 – $20,550 12% $10,276 - $41,775 $20,551 - $83,550 22% $41,776 - $89,075 $83,551 - $178,150 24% $89,076 - $170,050 $178,151 - $340,100 32% $170,051 - $215,950 $340,101 - $431,900 35% $215,951 - $539,900 $431,901 - $647,850 37% $539,901 + $647,851 + Source: Internal Revenue Service Tax Diversification The ability to pull from different accounts and smooth out your tax bracket requires having money invested in at least two, but ideally three tax pools, which are taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free. We call this tax diversification, and it gives you the flexibility you need in retirement. Many customers have the majority of their savings in Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs, and little to no money in Roth accounts. That means you have no choice as to the order in which you withdraw from your investments, and you will pay taxes accordingly. Most retirees should seek to have some money in all three tax pools. The benefits of investment diversification are well known and often talked about, but tax diversification is not something that is often discussed. Generally, the only way to get money into each tax pool is by making direct contributions. However, a Roth conversion can be a powerful strategy to move money between tax pools. Building a tax-efficient retirement income plan is one of the main reasons tax diversification is so important. Extend The Life Of Your Portfolio Having a retirement income plan that incorporates taxes can extend the life of your portfolio. In general, we recommend you withdraw from your taxable accounts first, then your tax-deferred accounts, and lastly from your tax-free accounts. Implementing strategies such as Tax Loss Harvesting+, specific lot selection, and account specific asset allocation can further reduce or delay taxes. You should also smooth out any bumps in your tax bracket during retirement by accelerating tax-deferred withdrawals during low tax years and choosing tax-free withdrawals during high tax years. To do this, you must have money in all three “tax pools” (taxable, tax-deferred and tax-free). We call this tax diversification. Please note that Betterment is not a tax advisor. While we suggest everyone consult a tax professional to discuss their particular situation, those with more complicated situations such as complex estate planning or charitable giving may also want to consult an estate planning attorney. Even in such cases, we hope that these guidelines will still provide a solid foundation for your retirement income strategy. This article is intended to be educational in nature, and not meant to be relied upon as tax or investment advice. 1 As of the date published, long-term capital gains are generally taxed at 15%. However, if your taxable income is greater than $459,750 ($517,200 married filing jointly), you will pay 20% on long-term capital gains. An additional 3.8% Medicare Surtax also applies to those whose MAGI is above $200,000 single/$250,000 married filing jointly. Still, the tax rate on these long-term capital gains will be lower than your tax rate on ordinary income, so the reasoning still applies. Conversely, taxpayers with taxable income below $41,675 ($83,350 married filing jointly) pay 0% tax on long-term capital gains, making this strategy even more appealing.

      How Robo-Advisors Guide Your Investing  Here’s everything you need to know In 10 seconds A robo-advisor is a digital investment platform. Using algorithms, it automatically manages your investments according to your goals. In 1 minute Robo-advisors like Betterment use formulas to make smart investment decisions, lowering your cost and seeking to reduce human error in comparison to traditional financial advisors. This approach can give you some unique advantages. Here are the five principles that drive robo-advisors’ approach to investing. Personalization. You’re the most important part of the equation. We adjust our algorithms to fit your goals and circumstances. Automation and discipline. Avoid some common investor mistakes by automating your deposits and resisting the urge to meddle with your portfolio. Robo-advisors aim to make this easy, with the hope that you can reach your goals sooner and keep more in your pocket. Diversification. Robo-advisors set up your portfolio for long-term success by investing in a wide range of assets. Diversification prevents you from being overly exposed to concentrated risks. Lower fees and costs. Algorithms don’t have salaries. It takes a lot less overhead to automate portfolio management.&nbsp; Manage taxes. Taxes are often unavoidable. But with savvy investment moves, you may be able to offset them. Robo-advisors like Betterment can do this automatically if you choose, with features like Tax Loss Harvesting.&nbsp; If you have more time, we can unpack these principles in more detail. In 5 minutes In this article, we’ll: Explain what robo-advisors are Walk you through our five principles of investing What are robo-advisors? A robo-advisor is basically an automated financial advisor. Just like a human financial advisor, a robo-advisor gives recommendations based on your personal financial goals and circumstances. But instead of having a human manage your investment portfolio, a robo-advisor uses algorithms designed to find the optimal investment approach and maximize your returns. It’s technology that helps you manage your money. You can have as much or as little responsibility as you like. The robo-advisor gives you the data-driven insights you need to make wise choices or fully automate your investments. The biggest difference from a human financial advisor? A robo-advisor can cost you far less.&nbsp; Bottom line: Robo-advisors are able to give you similar performance to a financial advisor, but without the steep fees. So you can keep more of what your investments earn. So what guides a robo-advisor’s recommendations? There are five key principles.&nbsp; 1. Personalization We want you to reach your financial goals. So, we start by learning about you. What do you want to achieve? How soon do you want to achieve it? The right investment depends on how much you need to earn and how much time you have to earn it.&nbsp; Not sure how much you need to reach your goal? Or how much you can even invest? We can help with that, too. We explore how things like your income, where you live, and your tax bracket affect what your goal looks like and how fast you can reach it. The result is clear, achievable goals that fit your life and help you get the most from your accounts. 2. Automation and discipline With automatic deposits and decisions based on algorithms, it’s easy to make steady progress toward your goals. It’s also easier to avoid common investor mistakes. Your portfolio will likely experience short-term losses here and there. It’s part of investing. And your reactions to these losses can have a huge impact on your long-term success. You can’t let emotions get in the way of your goals. By automating your portfolio and staying disciplined about investing, you’re better equipped to ride out the short-term losses and enjoy long-term gains. 3. Diversification We’re not here to help you pick the perfect stock. Investing in a single financial asset leaves you vulnerable to that asset’s risks. With a single stock, you could lose everything if a company goes bankrupt, performs poorly, or gets some bad press.&nbsp; Instead, we help you build a well-diversified portfolio. Diversification spreads your investments across assets, asset classes, and even markets, lowering your overall risk. We automatically diversify your portfolio based on your goals and desires.&nbsp; Through socially responsible investing (SRI), you can even diversify your portfolio according to your values.&nbsp; Want to invest in environmentally-conscious companies? Done. How about businesses that demonstrate a commitment to social values? Check. Want to have the broadest positive impact you can? Easy. We have three SRI portfolios to choose from. Note that higher bond allocations in your SRI portfolio decrease the percentage attributable to socially responsible ETFs. However you diversify, this strategy helps you make steady progress toward your goal.&nbsp; 4. Lower fees and costs A robo-advisor can save you a lot of money in fees and ongoing costs. We remove human advisors from the equation—unless you want them. When you have Assets Under Management (AUM) with a robo-advisor, the fees are typically a fraction of what you’d pay for a financial advisor. Our fees are just 0.25% annually. With a financial advisor, you’re looking at more like 1% to 2%. And since everything is based on algorithms, you won’t pay extra for rebalancing and making other changes to your portfolio. 5. Manage taxes Taxes are one of the trickiest parts of investing. Sell for a profit at the wrong time, and you’ll be on the hook for short-term capital gains taxes. Sell the right asset for a loss at the right time, and you can offset taxes through tax-loss harvesting. Managing taxes wisely helps keep your gains consistent and maximize what you get to keep. With a robo-advisor like Betterment, this can happen automatically if you elect this feature. The algorithm optimizes your portfolio to try and keep you from being hit hard by taxes. A financial advisor can do this too, but will usually charge an additional fee. Put your financial goals on cruise control. Investing doesn’t have to be difficult. And reaching your financial goals doesn’t have to take all your time and attention. With a robo-advisor and a smart strategy, you can create your plan and let the algorithms do the rest.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Buying A Home: Down Payments, Mortgages, And Saving For Your Future  Your home may be the largest single purchase you make during your lifetime. That can make it both incredibly exciting and nerve wracking. Purchasing a primary residence often falls in the grey area between a pure investment (meant to increase one’s capital) and a consumer good (meant to increase one’s satisfaction). Your home has aspects of both, and we recognize that you may purchase a home for reasons that are not strictly monetary, such as being in a particular school district or proximity to one’s family. Those are perfectly valid inputs to your purchasing decision. However, as your financial advisor, this guide will focus primarily on the financial aspects of your potential home purchase: We’ll do this by walking through the five tasks that should be done before you purchase your home. 1. Build your emergency fund. Houses are built on top of foundations to help keep them stable. Just like houses, your finances also need a stable foundation. Part of that includes your emergency fund. We recommend that, before purchasing a home, you should have a fully-funded emergency fund. Your emergency fund should be a minimum of three months’ worth of expenses. How big your emergency fund should be is a common question. By definition, emergencies are difficult to plan for. We don’t know when they will occur or how much they will cost. But we do know that life doesn’t always go smoothly, and thus that we should plan ahead for unexpected emergencies. Emergency funds are important for everyone, but especially so if you are a homeowner. When you are a renter, your landlord is likely responsible for the majority of repairs and maintenance of your building. As a homeowner, that responsibility now falls on your shoulders. Yes, owning a home can be a good investment, but it can also be an expensive endeavor. That is exactly why you should not purchase a home before having a fully-funded emergency fund. And don’t forget that your monthly expenses may increase once you purchase your new home. To determine the appropriate size for your emergency fund, we recommend using what your monthly expenses will be after you own your new home, not just what they are today. Open your Safety Net Get Started 2. Choose a fixed-rate mortgage. According to 2020 survey data by the National Association of Realtors®, 86% of home buyers took out a mortgage. This means that most people have to choose which type of mortgage is appropriate for them, and one of the key factors is deciding between an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) and a fixed-rate mortgage (FRM). Betterment generally recommends choosing a fixed-rate mortgage. Here’s why: As shown below, ARMs usually—but not always—offer a lower initial interest rate than FRMs. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Visualization of data by Betterment. But this lower rate comes with additional risk. With an ARM, your monthly payment can increase over time, and it is difficult to predict what those payments will be. This may make it tough to stick to a budget and plan for your other financial goals. Fixed-rate mortgages, on the other hand, lock in the interest rate for the lifetime of the loan. This stability makes budgeting and planning for your financial future much easier. Locking in an interest rate for the duration of your mortgage helps you budget and minimizes risk. Luckily, most home buyers do choose a fixed-rate mortgage. According to 2020 survey data by the National Association of Realtors®, 89% of home buyers who financed their home purchase used a fixed-rate mortgage, and this was very consistent across all age groups. Research by the Urban Institute also shows FRMs have accounted for the vast majority of mortgages over the past 2 decades. Source: National Association of Realtors®, 2020 Home Buyers and Sellers Generational Trends. Visualization of data by Betterment. 3. Save For The Upfront Costs: Down Payment And Closing You’ll need more than just your emergency fund to purchase your dream home. You’ll also need a down payment and money for closing costs. Betterment recommends making a down payment of at least 20%, and setting aside about 2% of the home purchase for closing costs. A 2020 National Association of Realtors® survey shows the median down payment amount for home purchases is 12%. As the chart below shows, younger buyers tend to make smaller down payments than older buyers. Source: National Association of Realtors®, 2020 Home Buyers and Sellers Generational Trends.&nbsp; Visualization of data by Betterment. But is making an average down payment of only 12% a wise decision? It is true that you are often allowed to purchase a home with down payments far below 20%. For example: FHA loans allow down payments as small as 3.5%. Fannie Mae allows mortgages with down payments as small as 3%. VA loans allow you to purchase a home with no down payment. However, Betterment typically advises putting down at least 20% when purchasing your home. A down payment of 20% or more can help avoid Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI). Putting at least 20% down is also a good sign you are not overleveraging yourself. Lastly, a down payment of at least 20% may help lower your interest rate. This is acknowledged by the CFPB and seems to be true when we compare interest rates of mortgages with Loan-to-Values (LTVs) below and above 80%, as shown below. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Visualization of data by Betterment. Depending on your situation, it may even make sense to go above a 20% down payment. Just remember, you shouldn’t put every spare dollar you have into your home, as that will likely mean you don’t have enough liquid assets elsewhere for things such as your emergency fund and other financial goals like retirement. Closing Costs In addition to a down payment, buying a home also has significant transaction costs. These transaction costs are commonly referred to as “closing costs” or “settlement costs.” Closing costs depend on many factors, such as where you live and the price of the home. ClosingCorp, a company that specializes in closing costs and services, conducted a study that analyzed 2.9 million home purchases throughout 2020. They found that closing costs for buyers averaged 1.69% of the home’s purchase price, and ranged between states from a low of 0.71% of the home price (Missouri) up to a high of 5.90% of the home price (Delaware). The chart below shows more detail. Source: ClosingCorp, 2020 Closing Cost Trends. Visualization of data by Betterment. As a starting point, we recommend saving up about 2% of the home price (about the national average) for closing costs. But of course, if your state tends to be much higher or lower than that, you should plan accordingly. In total, that means that you should generally save at least 20% of the home price to go towards a down payment, and around 2% for estimated closing costs. With Betterment, you can open a Major Purchase goal and save for your downpayment and closing costs using either a cash portfolio or investing portfolio, depending on your risk tolerance and when you think you’ll buy your home. 4. Think Long-Term We mentioned the closing costs for buyers above, but remember: There are also closing costs when you sell your home. These closing costs mean it may take you a while to break even on your purchase, and that selling your home soon after is more likely to result in a financial loss. That’s why Betterment doesn’t recommend buying a home unless you plan to own that home for at least 4 years, and ideally longer. Unfortunately, closing costs for selling your home tend to be even higher than when you buy a home. Zillow, Bankrate, NerdWallet, The Balance and Opendoor all estimate them at around 8% to 10% of the home price. Betterment’s research analyzed closing costs for both buying and selling, the opportunity costs of potentially investing that money, and more. It shows that the average expected breakeven time is about 4 years as shown below. Of course, this will depend on many factors, but is helpful as a general guide. Thus, if you do not plan to own your home for at least 4 years, you should think carefully on whether buying a home is a smart move at this point in your life. Source: Betterment, Is Buying A Home A Good Investment? Visualization of data by Betterment. Luckily, it appears that most home buyers stay in their homes beyond our 4-year rule of thumb. The chart below is built from 2020 survey data by the National Association of Realtors®. It shows how long individuals of various age groups stayed in their previous homes before selling them. Across all age groups, the median length of time was 10 years, which is more than double our 4-year rule of thumb. That’s excellent. However, we can see that younger buyers, on average, come in well below the 10-year median, which indicates they are more at risk of not breaking even on their home purchases. Source: National Association of Realtors®, 2020 Home Buyers and Sellers Generational Trends. Visualization of data by Betterment. Some things you can do to help ensure you stay in your home long enough to at least break even include: If you’re buying a home in an area you don’t know very well, consider renting in the neighborhood first to make sure you actually enjoy living there. Think ahead and make sure the home makes sense for you 4 years from now, not just you today. Are you planning on having kids soon? Might your elderly parents move in with you? How stable is your job? All of these are good questions to consider. Don’t rush your home purchase. Take your time and think through this very large decision. The phrase “measure twice, cut once” is very applicable to home purchases. 5. Calculate Your Monthly Affordability The upfront costs are just one component of home affordability. The other is the ongoing monthly costs. Betterment recommends building a financial plan to determine how much home you can afford while still achieving your other financial goals. But if you don’t have a financial plan, we recommend not exceeding a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio of 36%. In other words, you take your monthly debt payments (including your housing costs), and divide them by your gross monthly income. Lenders often use this as one factor when it comes to approving you for a mortgage. Debt Income Ratios There are lots of rules in terms of what counts as income and what counts as debt. These rules are all outlined in parts of Fannie Mae’s Selling Guide and Freddie Mac’s Seller/Servicer Guide. While the above formula is just an estimate, it is helpful for planning purposes. In certain cases Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will allow debt-to-income ratios as high as 45%-50%. But just because you can get approved for that, doesn’t mean it makes financial sense to do so. Keep in mind that the lender’s concern is your ability to repay the money they lent you. They are far less concerned with whether or not you can also afford to retire or send your kids to college. The debt to income ratio calculation also doesn’t factor in income taxes or home repairs, both of which can be significant. This is all to say that using DTI ratios to calculate home affordability may be an okay starting point, but they fail to capture many key inputs for calculating how much you personally can afford. We’ll outline our preferred alternative below, but if you do choose to use a DTI ratio, we recommend using a maximum of 36%. That means all of your debts—including your housing payment—should not exceed 36% of your gross income. In our opinion, the best way to determine how much home you can afford is to build a financial plan. That way, you can identify your various financial goals, and calculate how much you need to be saving on a regular basis to achieve those goals. With the confidence that your other goals are on-track, any excess cash flow can be used towards monthly housing costs. Think of this as starting with your financial goals, and then backing into home affordability, instead of the other way around. Wrapping Things Up If owning a home is important to you, you can use the five steps in this guide to help you make a wiser purchasing decision. Have an emergency fund of at least three months’ worth of expenses to help with unexpected maintenance and emergencies. Choose a fixed-rate mortgage to help keep your budget stable. Save for a minimum 20% down payment to avoid PMI, and plan for paying ~2% in closing costs. Don’t buy a home unless you plan to own it for at least 4 years. Otherwise, you are not likely to break even after you factor in the various costs of homeownership. Build a financial plan to determine your monthly affordability, but as a starting point, don’t exceed a debt-to-income ratio of 36%.

      Betterment’s Retirement Advice Tools Explained  Betterment aligns our investment advice with what it’s really like to pursue your financial goals. Learn about our retirement planning advice and how it can help you. TABLE OF CONTENTS Define What Retirement Means To You Setting Up Your Retirement Projections At Betterment Understanding Betterment’s Recommendations Taking Action Saving for retirement is one of the most popular reasons people use Betterment. This makes sense, since almost everybody dreams of retiring some day (or at least having the option to quit working or switch careers, if they choose). That’s why Betterment offers retirement tools in your account that allow you to define what retirement means to you, and then run projections that give guidance on whether your goal is on-track or off-track. Our advanced projections include key inputs like Social Security, inflation, life expectancy, and even investment accounts not held at Betterment. Once you have your retirement projections setup in your retirement goal, Betterment will give you personalized advice on how much you should be saving towards retirement, which accounts are most optimal for you, and how you should be invested. You can even run different “what-if” scenarios to see how things like retiring earlier, or saving more, affect your projections. Of course, we make it easy for you to then take action and make your money work for you. For example, you can open various types of retirement accounts. You can also enable our many automated tools to help you save more, manage your investments, and manage taxes. We even work to make rolling over other retirement accounts as easy as possible. Let’s walk through each of these areas in more detail, so you can learn how to make the most of Betterment’s retirement planning tools. Define what retirement means to you. Each person’s retirement plan is unique. That’s why we allow you to tell us how and when you’d like to retire, and then we shape our advice around those inputs. Afterall, our advice will be very different if you plan on retiring at age 55 vs. age 75. This is what we call goal-based investing, where you tell us your various financial goals, and we give you advice on how to achieve them. For many individuals, the initial step of defining retirement can be difficult. This is understandable. We often hear questions like “how do I know how much money I’ll spend in retirement?” or “can I retire tomorrow?” Don’t worry. Betterment built tools to help you answer these tough questions. Once you open a retirement goal in your Betterment account, our retirement planning tool will walk you through how to estimate both your retirement spending and retirement age in order to set up your plan. Estimating Retirement Spending How much you would like to spend during your retirement is the most important driver of your retirement plan, but it is often the hardest part to predict. Maybe your kids will be independent by then, but health care may cost more. Maybe your house will be paid off, but you’ll also want to travel more. These are just a few examples of how some spending categories may decrease, while others may increase. If you’re one of the few who happen to have a good idea of what you’d like to spend during retirement, we allow you to simply input that number. For those who are unsure, we have a helpful calculator that will automatically estimate a spending number for you. This number can serve as a starting point, but you can always override it. We then estimate your retirement spending by running key data points through a spending estimate formula. This formula includes expected wage increases (which tend to be higher than general inflation), cost of living data for your particular zip code, and an estimated percentage of income used to support your lifestyle (i.e. spent on goods and services) based on data from individuals with similar income to you. While not an exhaustive list, these data points provide a useful spending overview that are factored into our advice. Estimating Retirement Age When you’ll retire is also difficult to predict. The choice isn’t always yours to make either, as can be the case with unexpected health issues or being forced out of work. As with your retirement spending, if you have a particular retirement age in mind, you can simply enter it into our system. For those who are unsure, we default you to age 68, which is just beyond Full Retirement Age (FRA), as defined by the Social Security Administration, for many of our customers. Making Changes And Updates We know that life happens, and things change. The retirement plan you set up in your 30’s or 40’s may become outdated. That’s why we build flexibility into our retirement projections, and allow you to make changes to your plan. You can easily update your desired retirement spending or desired retirement age at any time. When you do, we will automatically update our projections based on your new inputs. This way, you can ensure your retirement plan is always up-to-date. In fact, we encourage you to review your retirement projections periodically for this exact reason. As a general guideline, you should review your retirement projections once per year, or after any major life event like a promotion, change in marital status, birth of a child, or other similar event. Setting Up Your Retirement Projections At Betterment Now that you’ve defined what retirement means to you, it’s time to run some projections and determine if you seem on-track or off-track to meet your retirement goal. Betterment will calculate this for you, but first we need to gather some information about your situation. The more information you tell us, the more accurate our corresponding projections can be. Existing Savings: Tell us which accounts you already have for retirement, so we can give you credit for the savings you already have. This should not include accounts that are set aside for other purposes, like emergency funds, buying a house, or your kid’s college. But it should include retirement accounts, even if they are not held at Betterment. Common examples of this are 401(k)s and your spouse’s retirement accounts as well. We recommend syncing these accounts to your Betterment account. Planned Future Savings: We can also factor in future retirement savings that you expect to make. Under each account, you can tell us how much you plan to contribute per year. You can even include employer matches, if applicable, to your workplace retirement accounts. Social Security Benefits: Social Security plays a key role in retirement for millions of Americans. We use your current income to estimate Social Security benefits according to the U.S. Social Security Administration’s benefit rules. We also adjust expected Social Security benefits based on projections from the Trustees Report. However, this is just an estimate, and you may prefer to instead login to your online Social Security account to view your official estimate and use that instead. Other Retirement Income: Some individuals may have other sources of retirement income, such as a pension or rental income. If this applies, you can enter that information into your projection inputs as well. Life Expectancy: We default your life expectancy to age 90, which is a conservative estimate compared to average life expectancies. Women tend to live longer than men, so keep this in mind as you adjust your retirement plan. You can always override our default age, if you’d like. With all of these inputs, your retirement plan should be personalized to your situation. We then use our Goal Projection and Advice methodology to estimate if you appear to be on-track to reach your retirement goal or not. If you’re off-track, that’s okay. We’ll give you recommendations to get on-track, and make it easy to take action on those recommendations. We don’t expect change to happen overnight, and even knowing where you stand is a great first step. Understanding Betterment’s Recommendations With your retirement projections in place, Betterment can now give you personalized recommendations to help you get on-track, or even if you are already on-track, to help maximize your savings and investments. The recommendations we give should answer many common questions we hear from customers, such as: How much should I be saving? Which accounts should I contribute to? How should I be invested? How much should I be saving? One of the most important recommendations we can give is telling you how much we estimate you should be saving per year to be on-track for retirement. Betterment will give you this top line number so that you have a target in mind to strive towards. Which accounts should I contribute to? For many people, you will need to combine multiple accounts to reach your goals and optimize your savings. Once you know how much you should be saving, we will also tell you which mix of accounts you should be putting those savings into, and show that to you in a prioritized list. This list includes things like tax bracket, employer match info, account fees, contribution limits, and more. This helps make sure your money is working as hard as possible for you. In particular, the use of tax-advantaged retirement accounts are an important benefit to consider when saving for retirement. Contributions to Traditional 401(k), Traditional 403(b), and Traditional IRA accounts are typically tax-deductible, which means you contribute on a pre-tax basis and normally don’t pay taxes until you make withdrawals. Contributions to Roth 401(k), Roth 403(b), and Roth IRA accounts are not tax-deductible, which means you contribute on an after-tax basis but they grow tax-free. How you contribute to your retirement accounts now can make a big difference over time. The earlier you invest, the more possibility there is for your investments to appreciate. This is especially true for retirement savings, because when you use tax-advantaged retirement accounts, such as IRAs or 401(k)s, all that time spent in the market can lead to benefits in tax-free growth. How should I be invested? Another critical component of your retirement plan is making sure you are invested appropriately. Betterment’s tools will give you feedback on key areas of your investments, even on your non-Betterment accounts. Our tools will give you feedback on how risky your investments are and if that risk level is appropriate given your time horizon to retirement. As a default for our recommended actions, if you have 20 or more years until you retire, we recommend 90% stocks. Then, our investment advice reduces your risk over time until your retirement date, when it hits 56% stocks. Finally, it glides down to 30% stocks during retirement. Our tools will also analyze your external accounts to determine if you seem to be paying more fees than you have to, and if you have too much cash sitting in your retirement accounts. Taking Action Even the best retirement plan won’t do you much good if you don’t take action. With Betterment’s smooth interface and powerful automation, taking action has rarely been easier. Open multiple retirement accounts: Many people can benefit from having multiple retirement accounts, like Roth and Traditional accounts. This can help you optimize for taxes and save beyond the contribution limits that some accounts have. Enable tax management algorithms: Optimizing for taxes can help your money work harder for you. Betterment is known for our advanced tax strategies like tax loss harvesting and tax coordination, which can both be put on autopilot in your Betterment accounts at the flip of a switch. Select a portfolio strategy: Betterment offers multiple portfolio strategies, which allow you to customize your investments and choose the strategy that best fits your needs and preferences. Enable investment management algorithms: Betterment allows you to automate many areas of investment management like rebalancing and auto-adjusting your investments over time. Roll over retirement accounts: Consolidating your investment accounts into Betterment may help you ensure your retirement portfolio is working together in a seamless, automated manner. Enable automatic deposits: Making retirement savings automatic can help you save more, and make maxing out your retirement accounts easier. Add beneficiaries: Adding beneficiaries can help ensure your money goes where you want it to, even after you pass away. All of these actions are important in setting up a comprehensive retirement plan that incorporates savings, investments, taxes, and more. Generally speaking, the earlier you start, the better off you’ll be. Start taking the above actions to set up your retirement plan at Betterment today.

      How to Estimate Your Tax Bracket When Investing  Knowing your tax bracket opens up a huge number of planning opportunities that have the potential to save you taxes and increase your investment returns. If you’re an investor, knowing your tax bracket opens up a number of planning opportunities that can decrease your tax liability and increase your investment returns. Investing based on your tax bracket is something that good CPAs and financial advisors, including Betterment, do for customers. Because the IRS taxes different components of investment income (e.g., dividends, capital gains, retirement withdrawals) in different ways depending on your tax bracket, knowing your tax bracket is an important part of optimizing your investment strategy. In this article, I’ll show you how to estimate your tax bracket and begin making more strategic decisions about your investments with regards to your income taxes. First, what is a tax bracket? In the United States, federal income tax follows what policy experts call a progressive tax system. This means that people with higher incomes are generally subject to a higher tax rate than people with lower incomes. Currently there are seven different tax brackets, ranging from 10% up to 37%. Below are the 2021 federal tax brackets if you are single or married filing jointly. 2021 Federal Tax Brackets Taxable Income Bracket: Filing as Single Taxable Income Bracket: Filing as Married, Filing Jointly Tax Rate $0 to $9,950 $0 to $19,900 10% $9,951 to $40,525 $19,901 to $81,050 12% $40,526 to $86,375 $81,051 to $172,750 22% $86,376 to $164,925 $172,751 to $329,850 24% $164,926 to $209,425 $329,851 to $418,850 32% $209,426 to $523,600 $418,851 to $628,300 35% $523,601 or more $628,301 or more 37% For example, if you are single and have taxable income of $75,000 this year, you fall into the 22% tax bracket. However, that does not mean that all $75,000 of your income will be taxed at 22%. Instead, tax brackets apply to each portion of your income, building up like a staircase. Here’s a visual to help explain. U.S. Federal Tax Brackets for Single Filers If you are a single individual with a taxable income of $75,000, the first $9,950 of your income will be taxed at 10%, then dollars $9,951 - $40,525 will be taxed at 12%, and dollars $40,526 – $75,000 will be taxed at 22%. If your taxable income were to grow, then dollars $75,001 — $86,375 would still be taxed at 22%, but after that, the dollars would be taxed at higher tax rates. Filing status (single, married, head of household, etc.) also affects your tax bracket. See the tax brackets for each filing status. How difficult is it to estimate my tax bracket? Luckily, estimating your tax bracket is much easier than actually calculating your exact taxes, because U.S. tax brackets are fairly wide. Just look at the 22% tax bracket. If you are filing as single, any income between $40,526 and $86,375 falls within that same tax bracket. That’s a big margin of error for making an estimate. The wide tax brackets allow you to estimate your tax bracket fairly accurately even at the start of the year, before you know how big your bonus will be, or how much you will donate to charity. Of course, the more detailed you are in calculating your tax bracket, the more accurate your estimate will be. And if you are near the cutoff between one bracket and the next, you will want to be as precise as possible. How Do I Estimate My Tax Bracket? Estimating your tax bracket requires two main pieces of information: Your estimated annual income Tax deductions you expect to file These are the same pieces of information you or your accountant deals with every year when you file your taxes. Normally, if your personal situation has not changed very much from last year, the easiest way to estimate your tax bracket is to look at your last year’s tax return. However, with the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, a lot of the rules and brackets have changed. Thus, it is wise for most people to estimate their bracket by crunching new numbers. Estimating Your Tax Bracket with Last Year’s Tax Return If you expect your situation to be roughly similar to last year, then open up last year’s tax return. If you review Form 1040, you can see your taxable income on Page 2, Line 43, titled “Taxable Income.” As long as you don’t have any major changes in your income or personal situation this year, you can use that number as an estimate to find the appropriate tax bracket on the table above (or the full set of tables provided by the Tax Foundation). Estimating Your Tax Bracket by Predicting Income, Deductions, and Exemptions Estimating your bracket requires a bit more work if your personal situation has changed from last year. For example, if you got married, changed jobs, had a child or bought a house, those, and many more factors, can all affect your tax bracket. It’s important to point out that your taxable income, the number you need to estimate your tax bracket, is not the same as your gross income. The IRS generally allows you to reduce your gross income through various deductions, before arriving at your taxable income. When Betterment calculates your estimated tax bracket, we use the two factors above to arrive at your estimated taxable income. You can use the same process. 1. Add up your Income. Add up your income from all expected sources for the year. This includes salaries, bonuses, interest, business income, pensions, dividends and more. If you’re married, don’t forget to include your spouse’s income sources. 2. Subtract Your Deductions Tax deductions reduce your taxable income. Common examples include mortgage interest, property taxes and charity, but you can find a full list on Schedule A – Itemized Deductions. If you don’t know your deductions, or don’t expect to have very many, simply subtract the Standard Deduction instead. For 2020, the standard deduction is $12,400 if you are single, and $24,800 if you are married filing jointly. By default, Betterment assumes you take the standard deduction. If you know your actual deductions will be significantly higher than the standard deduction, you should not use this assumption when estimating your bracket, and our default estimation will likely be inaccurate. The number you arrive at after reducing your gross income by deductions and exemptions is called your taxable income. This is an estimate of the number that would go on line 11b of your 1040, and the number that determines your tax bracket. Look up this number on the appropriate tax bracket table and see where you land. Again, this is only an estimate. There are countless other factors that can affect your marginal tax bracket such as exclusions, phaseouts and the alternative minimum tax. But for planning purposes, this estimation is more than sufficient for most investors. If you have reason to think you need a more detailed calculation to help formulate your financial plan for the year, you can consult with a tax professional. How Can I Use My Tax Bracket to Optimize My Investment Options? Now that you have an estimate of your tax bracket, you can use that information in many aspects of your financial plan. Here are a few ways that Betterment uses a tax bracket estimate to give you better, more personalized advice. Tax-Loss Harvesting: This is a powerful strategy that seeks to use the ups/downs of your investments to save you taxes. However, it typically only makes sense if you are in the 22% tax bracket or higher. For those in the 10% &amp; 12% tax brackets, capital gains are taxed differently, which could make this strategy not beneficial. Tax Coordination: This strategy reshuffles which investments you hold in which accounts to try to boost your after-tax returns. For the same reasons listed above, if you are in the 10% or 12% tax bracket, the benefits of this strategy are reduced significantly. Traditional vs. Roth Contributions: Choosing the proper retirement account to contribute to can also save you taxes both now and throughout your lifetime. Generally, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, Roth accounts are best. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in the future, Traditional accounts are best. That’s why our automated retirement planning advice estimates your current tax bracket and where we expect you to be in the future, and uses that information to recommend which retirement accounts make the most sense for you.In addition to these strategies, Betterment’s team of financial experts can help you with even more complex strategies such as Roth conversions, estimating taxes from moving outside investments to Betterment and structuring tax-efficient withdrawals during retirement. In addition to these strategies, Betterment’s team of financial experts can help you with even more complex strategies such as Roth conversions, estimating taxes from moving outside investments to Betterment and structuring tax-efficient withdrawals during retirement. Tax optimization is a critical part to your overall financial success, and knowing your tax bracket is a fundamental step toward optimizing your investment decisions. That’s why Betterment uses estimates of your bracket to&nbsp; recommend strategies tailored specifically to you. It’s just one way we partner with you to help maximize your money. Betterment is not a tax advisor, nor should any information herein be considered tax advice. Please consult a tax professional.

      Investing in Your 20s: 4 Major Financial Questions Answered  When you're in your 20s, you may be starting to invest or you might have some existing assets you need to take better care of. Pay attention to these major issues. For most of us, our 20s is the first decade of life where investing might become a priority. You may have just graduated college, and having landed your first few full-time jobs, you’re starting to get serious about putting your money to work. More likely than not, you’re motivated and eager to start forging your financial future. Unfortunately, eagerness alone isn’t enough to be a successful investor. Once you make the decision to start investing, and you’ve done a bit of research, dozens of new questions emerge. Questions like, “Should I invest or pay down debt?” or “What should I do to start a nest egg?” In this article, we’ll cover the top four questions we hear from investors in their twenties that we believe are important questions to be asking—and answering. “Should I invest aggressively just because I’m young?” “Should I pay down my debts or start investing?” “Should I contribute to a Roth or Traditional retirement account?” “How long should it take to see results?” Let’s explore these to help you develop a clearer path through your 20s. 1. “Should I invest aggressively just because I’m young?” Young investors often hear that they should invest aggressively because they “have time on their side.” That usually means investing in a high percentage of stocks and a small percentage of bonds or cash. While the logic is sound, it’s really only half of the story. And the half that is missing is the most important part: the foundation of your finances. The portion of your money that is for long-term goals, such as retirement, should most likely be invested aggressively. But in your twenties you have other financial goals besides just retirement. Let’s look at some common goals that should not have aggressive, high risk investments just because you’re young. A safety net. It’s extremely important to build up an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of your expenses. We usually recommend your safety net should have a portfolio allocation of no more than 40% stocks. Wedding costs. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median age of a first marriage for men is 29, and for women, it’s 27. You don’t want to have to delay matrimony just because the stock market took a dip, so money set aside for these goals should also probably be invested conservatively. A home down payment. The median age for purchasing a first home is age 32, according to the New York Times. That means most people should start saving for that house in their twenties. When saving for a relatively short-term goal—especially one as important as your first home—it likely doesn’t make sense to invest very aggressively. So how should you invest for these shorter-term goals? If you plan on keeping your savings in cash, make sure your money is working for you. Consider using a&nbsp;cash account like Cash Reserve, which could earn a higher rate than traditional savings accounts. If you want to invest your money, you should separate your savings into different buckets for each goal, and invest each bucket according to its time horizon. An example looks like this. The above graph is Betterment’s recommendation for how stock-to-bond allocations should change over time&nbsp;for a major purchase goal. And don’t forget to adjust your risk as your goal gets closer—or if you use Betterment, we’ll adjust your risk automatically for you. 2. “Should I pay down my debts or start investing?” The right risk level for your investments depends not just on your age, but on the purpose of that particular bucket of money. But should you even be investing in the first place? Or, would it be better to focus on paying down debt? According to Northwestern Mutual’s 2018 Planning &amp; Progress Study, millennials have an average of $36,000 in debt, mainly from student loans and credit cards. In some cases, paying down debt should be prioritized over investing, but that’s not always the case. Here’s one example: “Should I pay down a 4.5% mortgage or contribute to my 401(k) to get a 100% employer match?” Mathematically, the employer match is usually the right move. The return on a 100% employer match is usually better than saving 4.5% by paying extra on your mortgage if you’re planning to pay the same amount for either option. It comes down to what is the most optimal use of your next dollar. We've discussed the topic in more detail previously, but the quick summary is that, when deciding to pay off debt or invest, use this prioritized framework: Always make your minimum debt payments on time. Maximise the match in your employer-sponsored retirement plan. Pay off high-cost debt (anything 5%-6% or greater). Build your safety net. Save for retirement. Save for your other goals (home purchase, kid’s college). Read more about investing and paying off debt. 3. “Should I contribute to a Roth or Traditional retirement account?” Speaking of employer matches in your retirement account, which type of retirement account is best for you? Should you choose a Roth retirement account (e.g. Roth 401(k), Roth IRA) in your twenties? Or should you use a traditional account? As a quick refresher, here’s how Roth and traditional retirement accounts generally work: Traditional: Contributions to these accounts are usually pre-tax. In exchange for this upfront tax break, you usually must pay taxes on all future withdrawals. Roth: Contributions to these accounts are generally after-tax. Instead of getting a tax break today, all of the future earnings and qualified withdrawals will be tax-free. So you can’t avoid paying taxes, but at least you can choose when you pay them. Either now when you make the contribution, or in the future when you make the withdrawal. As a general rule: If your current tax bracket is higher than your expected tax bracket in retirement, you should choose the Traditional option. If your current tax bracket is the same or lower than your expected tax bracket in retirement, you should choose the Roth option. The good news is that Betterment’s retirement planning tool can do this all for you and recommend which is likely best for your situation. We estimate your current and future tax bracket, and even factor in additional factors like employer matches, fees and even your spouse’s accounts, if applicable. 4. “How long should it take to see investing results?” Humans are wired to seek immediate gratification. We want to see results and we want them fast. The investments we choose are no different. We want to see our money grow, even double or triple as fast as possible! We are always taught of the magic of compound interest, and how if you save $x amount over time, you’ll have so much money by the time you retire. That is great for initial motivation, but it’s important to understand that most of that growth happens later in life. In fact very little growth occurs while you are just starting. The graph below shows what happens over 30 years if you save $250/month in today’s dollars and earn a 7% rate of return. By the end you’ll have over $372,000! But it’s not until year 5 that you would earn more money than you contributed that year. And it would take 18 years for the total earnings in your account to be larger than your total contributions. How Compounding Works: Contributions vs. Future Earnings The figure shows a hypothetical example of compounding, based on a $3,000 annual contribution over 30 years with an assumed growth rate of 7%, compounded each year. This example is hypothetical and illustrates the general pattern of how compounding seems to work in the short term versus the long term. This figure is not based on or related to any Betterment portfolio or offering. The point is it can take time to see the fruits of your investing labor. That’s entirely normal. But don’t let that discourage you. Some things you can do early on to help are to make your saving automatic and reduce your fees. Both of these things will help you save more and make your money work harder. Use Your 20s To Your Advantage Your 20s are an important time in your financial life. It is the decade where you can build a strong foundation for decades to come. Whether that’s choosing the proper risk level for your goals, deciding to pay down debt or invest, or selecting the right retirement accounts. Making the right decisions now can save you the headache of having to correct these things later. Lastly, remember to stay the course. It can take time to see the type of growth you want in your account.

      Take on More Control with Flexible Portfolios  You may be an experienced investor who enjoys Betterment but would like to change aspects of our recommended portfolios. Enter Flexible Portfolios. Do you ever find yourself thinking... “I like the Betterment Portfolio in general, but I wish I could make some adjustments.” “I hold a lot of large-cap stocks outside of Betterment. Can I adjust the weight of my small- and mid-cap holdings to accommodate this?” Some Betterment customers do. That’s why we’ve developed a new feature for adjusting any Betterment goal’s recommended portfolio. We call it Flexible Portfolios. A Flexible Portfolio enables experienced investors to adjust the individual asset class weights in the Betterment Portfolio Strategy. At Betterment, our investment philosophy says that any investor should be aligned to their investments through a personalized financial plan. If you have views on your investments that differ from Betterment’s advice, we know it will be challenging for you to pursue that plan effectively. Just as we give you personalized control to follow our allocation advice or not, Flexible Portfolios helps investors follow Betterment’s broad array of financial advice without being limited to the specific individual asset class weights we recommend. How do Betterment Flexible Portfolios work? Start with the Betterment Portfolio Strategy. Betterment’s financial advice has several layers, and the portfolio we recommend to you (specifically, our stock allocation advice) is just one of them. At the core is Betterment’s evidence-based approach to building a diversified, risk-efficient portfolio strategy and our cost-aware selection of ETFs. Flexible Portfolios lets you benefit from this evidence-rich approach to building portfolios, but turns the control over to you for the weight of each asset class. Adjust portfolios based on each of your investment goals. At Betterment, a portfolio’s allocation is recommended to pursue a specific goal. A Flexible Portfolio enables you to take control of the portfolio for any given goal. If you have two different investment goals, you can use a Flexible Portfolio for one, and Betterment’s recommended portfolio for the other. Or different Flexible Portfolios for each goal. Take advantage of automation and tax optimization recommendations. Although use of a Flexible Portfolio means you’re not following Betterment’s portfolio recommendation, you still enjoy the same automation and tax features that help you save time and taxes while reaching your financial goals. The features include Tax Loss Harvesting+™, Tax Coordination™, and Tax Impact Preview, as well as features that help you automate your financial planning: auto-deposit, automatic rebalancing, and no manual trading. Get principled feedback on your Flexible Portfolio. For those who want the control offered by Flexible Portfolios, Betterment still provides immediate feedback on your adjustments. If you review Betterment’s principles for investing success, you’ll see that we believe maintaining diversification to manage risk is paramount. That’s why for any Flexible Portfolio you create, we’ll rate the resulting diversification and your relative risk before you make any investment switches. We want any customer with a Flexible Portfolio to understand the risks of a portfolio that is outside our recommendation. You can get started using a Flexible Portfolio by editing the portfolio strategy on an existing goal—then choosing “Design a Flexible Portfolio.” Or, if you’re starting a new goal, choose “See other portfolios” when viewing our recommended portfolio to start a Flexible Portfolio. When does a Flexible Portfolio make sense? You can think of a Flexible Portfolio as a decision to take personalized control of your portfolio and deviate from Betterment’s recommendation. So, while small changes should not cause dramatic shifts in your expected investment outcomes, this feature is intended for experienced investors, and only those who have acceptable reasons for building a Flexible Portfolio. Our intention in offering Flexible Portfolios is to give you the option of control to tailor your portfolio while benefiting from the rest of Betterment’s advice. It’s part of our broader methodology of personalizing investment management: We offer guidance personalized to you for the aspects of your life we can reasonably help with, but we also give you a degree of control. Flexible Portfolios is one more way we offer you that control.

      Betterment’s Model for Financial Advice: An Overview  Saving enough, choosing the right accounts, deciding when you can buy a house or when to retire—all of these are essential decisions before you build an optimal portfolio. TABLE OF CONTENTS How Betterment Helps You Plan We Plan Despite the Future’s Uncertainty How We Estimate Market Performance How We Estimate Future Tax Rates How We Estimate Inflation Our Commitment to You: Constant Improvement Model Release Notes and Assumption Updates When it comes to investing, it’s easy to get lost in a myriad of decisions about strategies, diversification, investment costs, or funds to buy, to name a few. These decisions are important, but their apparent complexity can obscure an even more important question: What are you trying to accomplish with your portfolio? At Betterment, we deliver easy-to-use financial planning tools that help you design a plan to achieve your financial goals. And to that end, we continually update the tools we provide—factoring in new possible scenarios and redeveloping our assumptions as we learn about the future. In this article, we’ll outline how our model works and provide a list of updates we’ve made. Planning for your future with financial goals Establishing financial goals, and a plan to achieve them, is critical. This is why Betterment has been a goal-based investing service since the beginning. Goals help root your thinking about the future, and they have well-documented behavioral benefits. Your situation can change, as can your goals, so it’s essential to have flexibility in your plan, and the ability to answer key “what-if” questions. Goals help enable a financial advisor—automated or human—to give you quality advice, which can add significant value beyond the simple returns of a portfolio. How Betterment helps you plan Betterment’s online financial planning tools are designed to make it easy to set up a personalized, flexible, easy-to-track plan. Starting in our signup process, you establish your first goal, and can add other goals at any time once signed up. A goal is a future spending need, and will fall into one of four categories, each with different attributes and investing advice. These categories are: Safety Net Major Purchase Retirement General Investing Once you choose a category, you provide details about the goal so that we can recommend a portfolio, a level of risk, and how to save (or withdraw, if in retirement) to help achieve the goal. Then you can use our tools to see how a one-time deposit, recurring deposits, and the time horizon change how you can achieve your goal. For more complex goals like retirement, our built-in retirement planning advice factors in other variables, such as the impact of Social Security, other income streams like rental real estate, as well as future spending, tax rates, and inflation. Here are some examples of questions you can start to answer with Betterment’s financial planning tools: How much do I need to save to put a downpayment on a house in five years? When can I retire? Can I retire early? How much should I save to retire at age X? What if I save more or less than that? How can a poor market affect my savings plan or retirement? What if Social Security isn’t around? How much do I have to save then? Should I use my 401(k) or an IRA? Should I use a Roth IRA / 401(k)? How much should I save in my Safety Net? If I save X per month, what can it be worth in 10 years? Our tools help provide guidance on all of these questions and more. And we think they are better than most financial planning tools for two key reasons: We keep your balance up-to-date at a high frequency, so you know where you stand and what to do next. Changes are simple to make and applied in real time, so you can update your goals and form a better game plan. We plan despite the future’s uncertainty The key challenge in planning for the future is that nobody can truly forecast the future. You can’t be sure how or when your situation will change, and we can never predict how external factors like shifting markets, inflation, or tax rates will change. However, as the statistician George Box once said, “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” As investors, our lack of ability to know the future should not mean we give up and stop planning. Instead, we should aim to identify the “useful” models Box was referring to—tools that factor in potential variability and allow you to envision how various changes are likely to affect your plan. Tools like these help you understand the range of potential outcomes, which will better inform the decisions you make today. For example, if financial markets (and thus your portfolio) perform worse than the average we expect (a “poor market” scenario), your savings may be wholly inadequate to meet your spending needs in retirement. To help avoid this result, you could save more today to increase your projected future income, even if a poor market occurs. If you didn’t know this information in advance, it would be too late to adjust if a poor market scenario did occur. How we estimate market performance One of the key estimates about the future we make is how your portfolio will perform in the future. As you can see from the blue shading on our Advice tab in Figure 1, there is a wide range of potential portfolio growth results, depending on if the market performs poorly, or well over the time horizon of the goal. Figure 1: Setting a major purchase goal to buy a Tesla Model S using Betterment There are many ways to estimate future returns of a portfolio. The simplest way, used by many financial calculators, is to assume a constant average return which is typically based on historical returns of a typical benchmark, like the S&amp;P 500 index. A common estimate is 7% for U.S. stocks. While there may be benefits to simple assumptions, this one has several problems: You are not usually invested exactly like that benchmark. For example, you might hold both stocks and bonds. Different mixes of these assets in your portfolio will have different ranges of outcomes. You probably have multiple financial goals, with different time horizons. For example, your retirement account should not be invested the same was as an education fund for your kids, because one is based on spending in (say) 30 years, the other in 15 years. Thus you may hold different risk portfolios for each goal which should not have the same returns assumption. Using a historical estimate is very sensitive to the time horizon used to calculate it. Betterment makes several improvements on this method to help make our estimates more accurate: We use a return estimate for the specific portfolio you select, for each goal. For example, our estimate for a 90% stock portfolio is different than that of a 85% stock portfolio. This estimate is based on the specific asset classes that you actually hold. We consider volatility in our returns estimates. This allows us to produce the range of returns you see on the Advice tab, and also allows configuring the chance of success of our models. For example, our savings estimates assume a somewhat conservative 40th percentile outcome (60% chance of success) rather than the simple average (a 50% chance of success). The return we assume is based on risk-free rate and an asset premium. The “risk free rate” (which is the return a risk-free asset such as a U.S. Treasury bill will return), and an equity (or bond) “risk premium” or excess return, which is how much we expect risky assets like stocks and bonds to return in addition to this risk-free rate. We assume risk-free returns vary over time. You probably know that interest rates (set by the Fed via it’s U.S. Treasury buying and selling program) are low right now, and most economists expect them to rise. The returns of each stock or bond fund in your portfolio are expected to be in addition to the safe or “risk-free” Treasury rates. So when rates rise, so should our expectations of your returns. Our projections assume these will increase from their low now to more normal rates in the future. (Learn more about this) Also, we make the typical assumption that longer term treasuries have higher returns than short term, due to the added interest rate risk they contain. How we estimate future tax rates Just like how no one can predict the outcome of a presidential election, we can’t predict what tax rates in the future will be. However, we are pretty sure that certain incomes and account types will be subject to some tax, so good planning tools like Betterment’s factor in some adjustment for taxes. This is most relevant in retirement planning, where taxes affect the account types you might use (e.g., IRA or Roth IRA) and your current and future income. How we incorporate tax rate estimates to our retirement planning advice: We use the latest federal tax data available. For federal taxes, these are known in advance and updated every Jan. 1. For state tax rates, this data is harder to come by, and we update them as soon as reasonably possible. Historically that is six to 12 months into the year. For example, given it’s early in 2018, we are still using 2017 state tax rates. Tax bracket ranges are typically adjusted for inflation, so we assume that inflation by itself will not cause major changes to tax rate assumptions. Your income will be different in the future, which affects your tax rate. We account for income increases due to inflation and typical salary growth (see our full retirement planning methodology for more information). We use these factors to estimate what your future tax rate might be. We allow tax deduction and dependent overrides, which can affect your personal rate. How we estimate inflation Like tax rates, we cannot know how inflation will change through time. There are certain known historical ranges and understood targets set by fiscal policy. The most important thing is to factor in some inflation, especially for long-term goals like retirement, because we know it won’t be zero. Good tools will always do this, even if assumptions vary from tool to tool. At Betterment, by default we currently assume a 2% inflation rate in our retirement planning advice and in our safe withdrawal advice, which is what the Fed currently targets. You can override this value in Edit Assumptions if you have a different view. Read more about our assumption on inflation. Inflation: 12-Month Average Consumer Price Index Growth Figure 2:&nbsp;Inflation through time, as shown by the Consumer Price Index for all consumers and all items. Seasonally adjusted.&nbsp;Data Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data Our commitment to you: constant improvement Just as you should review your goals and their status periodically, our commitment to you is to keep our tools updated and as forward-thinking as possible. Our Investment Committee and team of analysts periodically review our economic, tax, and returns assumptions, as well as make improvements to the capabilities of our tools. For example, we make regular updates to our risk-free rates, especially now that rates have started to move upward. An example of how we invest in our tools is the release of RetireGuide in 2015, which was the first time we factored Social Security, inflation, and taxes into our retirement calculations. These ongoing improvements, as well as actual performance of your account, can cause our recommendations to vary, so we recommend reviewing your goals and status at least once per year. In order to be transparent about the changes we make, we keep a log of all historical changes to our models. You can also review our Projections Methodology and methodology for more model details and limitations.

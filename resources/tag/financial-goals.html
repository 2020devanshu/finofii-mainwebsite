      Goal Projection and Advice Methodology  Betterment helps you get on track to meet your goals by providing projections and advice on allocation, savings, and withdrawals. Our methodology for doing so involves some assumptions worth exploring. TABLE OF CONTENTS Projection Methodology and Assumptions Methodology and Assumptions Withdrawal Advice Methodology and Assumptions For Retirement Goals Graph Explanation Goal Status - On Track or Off Track Limitations Betterment provides allocation, savings and withdrawal advice alongside a projection graph when customers view their goal projection under “Plan.” The graph is intended to show the possible future investment values in order to illustrate the impact of different contribution and withdrawal choices, investment time horizons, and portfolio allocations. Actual individual investor performance has and will vary depending on market performance, the time of the initial investment, amount and frequency of contributions or withdrawals, intra-period allocation changes and taxes. An indication of “On Track” is not a guarantee of achieving a goal in the future. Acting on savings and withdrawal advice is not a guarantee that goals will be met or that the investment will meet cost of living needs throughout one’s life. See our Terms and Conditions. In the following sections, we’ll provide an overview of our methodology and assumptions for each component under “Plan” in a Betterment goal. Projection Methodology and Assumptions The expected investment portfolio returns used in the portfolio value projection results are based on the expected returns and risk free rate assumptions for your target Betterment portfolio allocation. (See more about how the expected returns are derived). This portfolio is set by the user-selected allocation to “stocks” and “bonds”. The allocation choice corresponds to weights of the underlying Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), as defined in our Portfolio. The recommended allocation mix is based on user investment profile including age, the goal type and time horizon. For Cash Goals, the expected return is based on the current APY on Cash Reserve, Betterment’s cash account, and risk free rate assumptions. The returns used are net of your current annual fee and we assume that fee holds throughout the investment. Cash Goals have no fee on your account balance (For Cash Reserve (“CR”), Betterment LLC only receives compensation from our program banks; Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities do not charge fees on your CR balance.), and our projections thus use the current APY when forecasting your Cash Goal account balance. In projecting your balance, we estimate the uncertainty in returns for both your investment portfolio and the underlying risk free rate. For Cash Goals, we assume in our projections that the interest rate for Cash Reserve will vary over time commensurate with any changes to the underlying risk free rate. Monthly Contributions or Withdrawals, if specified, are assumed to be made at the end of the month. We project your balance in monthly increments, never going below twelve months. We project allocation changes on a monthly basis. For users with remaining goal terms of less than one year, our projection assumes that you maintain the allocation at the end of the goal term rather than liquidate. We sometimes map external assets to proxy assets. For investments with available data, we map holdings to our asset classes for risk analysis. In some cases we do not have data for a specific investment, usually because the holding is a non-publicly-listed vehicle, such as a private 401(k) plan. In those cases, we use proxy tickers to determine the appropriate asset class exposures. Proxy tickers are provided by Plaid, our third-party data provider for connected accounts. Plaid uses a proprietary process to identify similar public securities to the unknown ticker using structural information (including security type and fund name) and to qualify the confidence level of the similarity. Betterment uses Plaid’s proxy tickers only for securities that pass a threshold confidence level of similarity. Plaid’s methodology may change over time, and Betterment will continuously evaluate any such changes. The monthly contributions estimate is based on a 60% likelihood of the portfolio value reaching the goal target at the end of the investment term. Calculations assume that you maintain the same portfolio strategy over time. If the portfolio strategy changes over time or has different expected returns, outcomes may be adjusted. Calculations will be updated based on the current portfolio. Charts and graphs are in nominal terms. Withdrawal Advice Methodology And Assumptions For Retirement Income Goals Only The monthly safe withdrawal is based on a 96% likelihood of having $0 or more at the end of the time horizon, assuming the following assumptions hold true. The safe withdrawal amount assumes the user adjusts the withdrawal rate and allocation according to our advice at least once per month. The safe withdrawal amount assumes the user does not live past the specified time horizon (“plan-to-age”). Calculations assume the current Betterment portfolio. If the portfolio changes over time or has different expected returns, outcomes may be adjusted. Calculations will&nbsp;be updated based on the current portfolio held. Withdrawal advice and graphs are in real terms, using an inflation rate of 2% The default time horizon (“plan-to age”) is 90 years of age, or age + 50 years if younger than 40, or age + 10 if older than 80. The model will use this value or the value entered by the user. Graph Explanation The Graph exhibits the possible range of projected portfolio values using color. The dark line indicates the projected portfolio value under average market conditions. This means that there is a 50% likelihood of portfolio values greater than this, and a 50% likelihood of portfolio values less than this. The lighter, shaded region indicates the range within which there is 80% likelihood of the projected portfolio value. This means that there is a 10% likelihood of portfolio values greater than the top of this region, and a 90% likelihood of portfolio values at least as high as the bottom of this region. Goal Status (Savings Goals): On Track Or Off Track The Betterment Savings Advice tool constantly tracks the portfolio performance and indicates the ability of the portfolio to reach the Goal target, assuming average market performance. The portfolio performance is categorized as “On Track” or “Off Track”, and Betterment makes recommendations to increase the likelihood of reaching the Goal target. The portfolio performance is “On Track” when the total projected portfolio value exceeds the Goal target assuming average market performance. This is equivalent to a likelihood of 50% and above of reaching the Goal target. The portfolio performance is “Off Track” when the future projected portfolio value (i.e. current balance plus future contributions, plus investment growth) is not sufficient to reach the Goal target assuming average market performance. This is equivalent to having less than 50% likelihood of reaching the Goal target. Betterment provides advice for bringing the goal back on track in three areas – either increasing the amount of future monthly contributions, or increasing the term of the investment or increasing the current balance in the account by making a one-time deposit. These recommendations are based on a relatively conservative stance, e.g. a 60% likelihood of projected portfolio value to reach the Goal target, compared to the 50% chance used by other models. Limitations The Goal target is a user input and may not be sufficient to provide income for actual spending or retirement income needs. The model does not account for any taxes, except for retirement goals. All non-retirement goal values are assumed to be pre-tax. The model does not account for forced withdrawals such as Required Minimum Distributions that must be taken from pre-tax qualified retirement accounts after a certain age. The model does not account for auto-deposits that are skipped. The savings model is in nominal terms and therefore does not have a direct inflation assumption. (The withdrawal model is in real terms, and uses a 2% inflation assumption). The withdrawal model does not take into account other sources of income outside the Betterment account. A full income plan should include all sources of income and a spending needs analysis. Past performance is not indicative of future results. These projections do not guarantee investment performance. Extreme market conditions, sustained high inflation, or other unforeseen events may reduce portfolio value and withdrawals. Income is not guaranteed.

      Using Investment Goals At Betterment  Goal-based saving. The idea is prized among financial advisors—and our team at Betterment—but to the everyday investor, it can be difficult to put into practice. TABLE OF CONTENTS What is a goal? What does a goal look like at Betterment? Retirement Saving Goals Retirement Income Goals Safety Net Goals Major Purchase Goals General Investing Goals How To Set Effective Goals&nbsp; Conclusion Why not just spend all your money today?&nbsp; Well, probably because you’ll need to spend it in the future.&nbsp; Most people envision things they want or need in order to be happy in the future. Things like having money just in case something happens, buying a house, having a kid (or two), sending your kids to college, and then finally, retiring. And amidst all of that, you’ll probably take some vacations, buy some cars, celebrate some anniversaries, etc.&nbsp; These are all examples of what we, at Betterment, loosely call “goals.” A goal is a way to set aside money for a specific purpose and track its progress. Some goals are big, some are small. Some are soon, some are far away. Some are non-negotiable, some are just nice-to-have.&nbsp; At Betterment, we help your money reflect your life goals. When you open an account with us, you can set up multiple goals to save into, track their progress, and we’ll provide guidance for each of them.&nbsp; In this article, we’ll go through how goals work at Betterment, different account types (IRA vs 401(k)), asset types (stocks vs bonds), and how to set effective financial goals.&nbsp; What is a goal?&nbsp; Goals are one of the best ways to set a personalized, reasonable financial plan for yourself. When you set up a goal, you’re identifying the purpose you have for your money and what you want to achieve with it.&nbsp; Betterment uses details about your goals to recommend the right account types, savings rates, and investments. The strongest financial plans consist of a set of prioritized, personal goals with the aim of helping you achieve the goals most important to you.&nbsp; When you provide a target date (when you expect to spend the money) and target amount (how much you think you will want to spend), we use a technique called “asset-liability management,” which aims to match future balances with future spending. In other words, we try to ensure that you have enough money for when you plan to spend it in the future. It’s ok if your goals aren’t clearly defined today or if they need to change in the future. As your goal becomes more refined, you can update it in your account. Since we know goals and priorities change over time, we make it easy for you to edit them. What does a goal look like at Betterment? One component of a financial goal is how much you want to spend, and when. For example, let’s say that you want a house downpayment and you think it would take about $50,000. Or, $120,000 for your child’s college tuition. Or $60,000 of annual retirement income for the 30 to 40 years you’ll spend in retirement. Any purpose you have for your money can be a goal, but they are most useful when you have an idea about the amount and timing. You can also personalize the name, cover image, and details of each goal.&nbsp; Goal Types You Can Open At Betterment Retirement (Saving): for those still working and saving towards retirement. Retirement (Income): for retirees taking withdrawals from accumulated money in retirement. Safety Net: an accessible emergency or rainy day fund to cover a gap in income or unexpected expenses. Major Purchase: a one-time big purchase, like house downpayment or a new car purchase. General Investing: for when you don’t have anything you want to plan for. Cash Goals: for specific goals held in Cash Reserve. At Betterment, you can set up as many of these goals as you want, and can change the goal type if the purpose for your money changes. You can also easily move money between goals.&nbsp; Once you’ve set up your goals, we’ll advise you on the right account types and investments you should use to help reach your goals.&nbsp; Each goal type comes with differentiated advice. For example, here’s a breakdown of the stock allocation advice, by goal type: Type of investing goal Most Aggressive Recommended Allocation (typical start of term, depending on age) Most Conservative Recommended Allocation (typical end of term, depending on age) Anticipated term Cash-out assumptions Retirement 90% Stocks, 10% Bonds 56% Stocks, 44% Bonds Up to 50 years Shift to a Retirement Income goal at the target date Retirement Income 56% Stocks, 44% Bonds 30% Stocks, 70% Bonds Up to 30 years Steady drawdown with dynamic withdrawal rate until target date Safety Net 30% Stocks, 70% Bonds 30% Stocks, 70% Bonds Targets date of achieving desired balance Up to full liquidation at any time General Investing 90% Stocks, 10% Bonds 55% Stocks, 45% Bonds Recommendation is based on investor age No liquidation Major Purchase (House, Education, Other) 90% Stocks, 10% Bonds 0% Stocks, 100% Bonds Between 1 and 35 years Full liquidation at target date Each of these goal types requires a different strategy to reflect how it will be spent and what accounts are available. Betterment’s advice and technology builds a different investment portfolio for each type of goal, based on its details as well as your financial circumstances. The risk level for each type of goal is a customized stock, bond and cash allocation recommendation, which is designed to automatically reduce risk as your remaining time horizon falls.&nbsp; For each goal type, we provide a maximum and minimum recommended stock allocation, based on your term, while making some assumptions about how you'll spend money from the goal. For example, whether you’ll spend it all at once for a Major Purchase goal or over time for a Retirement goal. You can choose a more aggressive or more conservative allocation in any goal type, including outside our recommendations. You can also select from a variety of portfolio strategies to reflect your personal investing views, such as our Socially Responsible Investing portfolios, or tailor your portfolio using our Flexible portfolio tool.&nbsp; Retirement Saving Goals If you are saving toward your future retirement, our retirement planning advice helps you make progress on your goal by using multiple accounts—including those held outside of Betterment (such as your spouse’s accounts) but synced into the retirement goal.&nbsp; Almost every future retiree will have multiple accounts—IRAs, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, HSAs, and/or taxable investment accounts—that help contribute to their retirement savings goal. So, we developed our methodology to match reality as closely as possible. In addition, retirement savings goals can utilize Tax Coordination™, Betterment’s approach to asset location. This increases your retirement spending by intelligently matching each asset class with the account that minimizes total tax drag costs—which are the lower take-home return you make once annual income taxes, capital gain taxes, and IRA/401(k) withdrawal taxes are taken into account—across all your funded accounts. Our retirement goals use a glidepath, reducing risk as your retirement date nears. When you have 20 or more years until you retire, we recommend 90% stocks. We also recommend you reduce your risk level over time, targeting a 56% stock allocation on retirement day. Once retired, you can shift to the next goal type, Retirement Income, which is optimized to provide paycheck-like distributions in retirement. Figure above shows a hypothetical example of a client who lives until they’re 90 years old. It does not represent actual client performance and is not indicative of future results. Actual results may vary based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to client changes inside the account and market fluctuation.&nbsp; Retirement Income Goals Once you retire, you’ll probably start taking withdrawals or distributions from your retirement goal. Betterment will recommend an appropriate allocation considering your age and years in retirement, and also recommend a regular distribution or withdrawal amount from your goal and retirement accounts.&nbsp; Our advice takes into account a variety of factors to suggest a safe target amount or withdrawal amount: Current balance Desired monthly income amount Minimum acceptable income level Desired certainty about not falling beneath minimum income level Remaining life expectancy For example, a 65-year-old person has a remaining life expectancy of nearly 21 years, according to projections used by the Social Security Administration. That is 21 years in which they will be both liquidating their portfolio but also investing their assets to support future years of consumption. With regards to the stock allocation, we seek to: Continue to generate above-inflation returns from your portfolio while in retirement Lower portfolio risk as you are further into retirement Safety Net Goals It’s almost certain that at some point, we’ll all experience a financial setback.&nbsp; A Safety Net goal is a high priority for everyone. It’s there to protect you if you experience a gap in income or a large unexpected expense. It also helps you not feel guilty about withdrawing money if something unfortunate happens—that’s what it’s there for!&nbsp; In crafting guidance for a Safety Net, we consider the possibility that you may not need to withdraw from it for a substantial period of time, and that we don’t want it losing buying power to inflation. When you do need it, it should be easily accessible and not significantly less than what you might need.&nbsp; We start by finding the safest allocation that will match or just beat inflation. This can depend on both inflation forecasts and risk-free rates, but it usually ranges from Cash (if interest rates are high enough), to 90% bonds (10% stocks) to 70% bonds (30% stocks). This sets the Safety Net goal apart in that the recommended allocations are not based on your goals time horizon, but just inflation.&nbsp; Since those allocations may come with some principal risk, we recommend considering a slight buffer in your Safety Net to ensure you have as much or more money as desired at all times. If you invest in Cash for your Safety Net, you won’t need the buffer, but you might not keep pace with inflation.&nbsp; Major Purchase Goals For a major purchase such as buying a car, a house, or even your child’s education, we usually anticipate spending the balance all at once, at a specific target date when you reach your goal.&nbsp; As the time of your desired target date approaches, our recommended stock allocation will become more conservative to ensure you don’t experience large losses close to the finish line. This de-risking will happen automatically unless you set your own allocation or turn off our auto-adjust feature. General Investing Goals It may be that you don’t have a specific planning purpose that matches the goal types we’ve listed above. In that case you can use a general investing goal. You can still personalize the name, allocation, and portfolio strategy in these goals, and we still recognize them as goals in your account.&nbsp; Since general investing goals have no specific spending plans, we consider them long-term goals where the balance might be used in retirement, to transfer wealth to the next generation, or convert your assets into a trust account at a later date. You can have multiple general investing goals for different purposes open at the same time.&nbsp; Our stock recommendation is based on your age and will glide from a maximum of 90% stocks to a minimum stock allocation of 55% stocks when you turn 65.&nbsp; We should note that by using a general investing goal, you could be exposed to unnecessary risk compared to using a more focused goal type. How To Set Effective Goals Our technology will work hard to help you set goals in realistic ways that match your financial situation. To align with our research on goal-based investing, it’s important to understand what makes for an effective goal. One framework to thoughtfully determine a prioritized set of goals is called the S.M.A.R.T. approach, which stands for: Specific Measurable Attainable Realistic Time-limited Make your goal specific. A specific goal is one with a clear description and a well-articulated set of circumstances. For example, if you’re saving for a child’s college education, a goal that is specific might look like the following on paper: “My goal is to pay for my child’s total higher education costs at a public university, including room and board, social events/clubs, and any other fees.” By stating how many of the possible education costs you’re planning to pay for (i.e. “total”), the goal statement above provides much more information about the size and shape of the future expenditure. Make your goal measurable. Making a goal measurable means that you can tell how close you are to achieving the goal using numbers. Generally, this means quantifying the specific information you know about—setting an accurate estimate of the total of the expenditure you expect to make. Here’s what a measurable goal looks like using our example: “My goal is to save a total of $800,000 to pay for all three of my children’s total higher education costs.” The total expenditure should account for all the factors that went into making your goal specific, but it should turn the various social and philosophical decisions you’ve made about your goal into a numerical sum. A savvy goal-setter will also account for taxes in setting the target amount.&nbsp; Ensure your goal is attainable. As you define a goal, you should make sure it’s attainable. Attainable goals are future expenditures you actually have the capability to achieve. For instance, if you make $80,000 in a year, saving $800,000 over five years is likely not attainable because even if you could save 100% of your income, you’d still come up short of your goal amount. We can make goals attainable by giving ourselves more time to save, lowering the target, or earning more money each year.&nbsp; Consider whether your goal is realistic. A goal is realistic if you have the time, resources, and discipline to achieve it. Generally, your goals will only be realistic if you take into account the other goals you have in your life. For example, when saving for college education, you probably will also need to invest for your retirement. If you don’t prioritize your goals, you may end up being less able to save as regularly or as much as you’d like—which lowers your chances of achieving either goal. Any goal should be time-limited. The last step in developing a S.M.A.R.T. goal is to make sure the goal is time-limited—i.e. Every goal should have a target date.&nbsp; Just as measurable goals quantify the total expenditure you expect to make, time-limited goals quantify the time you have to reach that expenditure amount. In most cases, you should try to set goals as far in advance as possible. For instance, rather than waiting until you have three children that will be going to college, it’s a good idea to start saving as soon as you start planning a family. A time-limited goal should also consider how frequently you can plan to contribute to the goal. Will you save a portion of every paycheck? Or will you save just once a year? An effective time-limited goal might read like the following: “My goal is to save a total of $800,000 over 18 years (by due date) to pay for all three of my children’s total higher education costs by putting aside at least $1,500 per paycheck per month.” A Map Of Your Financial Picture It’s totally okay to use estimated amounts and dates when creating goals you’re not quite sure of. In many cases, such as retirement or college savings, you might need additional research and external resources to predict how much money you’ll actually need to reach all the specific criteria of your goal. In getting started saving for a goal, it’s often better to be approximately right than to have no goal at all. By using a financial goals framework, you’ll push yourself to think broadly about all the factors of life that affect your financial future while balancing the joys of today with the hopes of tomorrow.

      How To Avoid Common Investor Mistakes  People often make financial decisions based on impulses and market shifts—here’s another way to do it. Investing mistakes are often rooted in our natural reactions. Let’s face it: We don’t always react the right way to information. And when enough investors have poor reactions, it can affect the entire market.&nbsp; Behavioral finance is a field of study that looks at how psychology affects financial decisions. It helps us understand why investors make common mistakes, so it’s easier to avoid them. But don’t worry—it doesn’t have to be complicated. Some of the most important lessons from this field are surprisingly simple. Try to invest with a goal in mind Investing can be one of the smartest financial decisions you can make. But a lot of investors start without knowing what they’re working toward—and that’s, well, less smart. When you don’t know why you’re building a financial portfolio, it’s a lot harder to know how to structure your investments. Instead, start with why. What do you want to be able to spend money on in the future? When are you going to use that money? These aren’t just stocks and bonds. Your investment is a future downpayment on a house. Your dream car. Retirement. College. Real things and experiences you want to be able to afford. Having a goal can help take the guesswork out of investing. You can calculate exactly how much you need to invest based on the range of potential outcomes. It’s also easier to decide where to put your investments. Retiring in 40 years? You might consider taking on more risk and allocating more in stocks. Hitting your goal next year? Play it safe. When you know how much you need to invest, break it into monthly chunks and automate your deposits. With recurring deposits, you're basically “paying yourself first” before worrying about other expenses. That way, you won’t talk yourself into skipping a month. (Which turns into two months, then three, and—oops, it’s been a year.) Focus on the long-term When you invest, you’ll likely have short-term losses here and there. It’s inevitable. And most times, it can be a mistake to make adjustments when your portfolio loses value. You can’t predict tomorrow’s performance based on yesterday’s. Even during the last ten years of steady growth, investors had to endure short-term losses at some point every year. Given enough time, the market trends upwards. And investments that perform poorly one day can easily make up for it the next. But that’s not what people tend to think about when they see their portfolio lose 15% of its value. They can panic. They make sweeping changes, reinvesting in funds and stocks that had short-term gains. And those big emotional decisions can do more harm than good. Investing is about long-term gains. Short-term losses are simply part of the process, so don’t panic every time there’s a loss. Watch out for “lifestyle creep” You don’t have to live frugally to be a successful investor. It helps, but the bigger issue is making sure that as your income increases, you stay in control of your lifestyle and spending. Most people see small pay increases over the course of their lives. 3% here. 8% there. When your regular spending increases with your income, it’s known as “lifestyle creep.” It can easily get in the way of saving enough to achieve your goals. If you have a lower income, it makes sense that more of your money goes toward basic necessities. But lifestyle creep happens when you gradually spend more on things you don’t need. Entertainment. Hobbies. Take out.&nbsp; Every time you increase your regular spending, your lifestyle costs more to maintain. You’ll likely need to save more for retirement. Your emergency fund may need to grow, too. Lifestyle creep is an even bigger problem if you started investing with the expectation that you’d invest more later. Some people feel intimidated by their goals, so they plan to increase the amount they invest when they start making more money. That’s fine—as long as you actually do it. Temporary increases in spending are OK. But as you make more money, don’t let a more extravagant lifestyle sabotage your goals. Five ways Betterment helps improve your investing behavior We help you see the big picture Our non-traditional portfolio presentation helps discourage investors from focusing on daily market movements. We show the constituents of your portfolio as the parts of a whole, but never the return of each individual component. This helps reduce the temptation to constantly adjust your allocation and make your portfolio less diverse. We encourage optimized deposit settings Setting up recurring deposits for the day after you get paid can set you up for success in a number of ways. First, it removes the constant temptation to pocket the cash instead. Second, it gives your paycheck just enough time to settle without letting that cash idle for long. And third, it can help rebalance your portfolio more tax-efficiently. We keep the focus on the future Our design helps you focus on decisions that matter—the ones about the future. Our minds assign a disproportionate significance to daily volatility, but it rarely impacts our long-term outlook. So instead of emphasizing daily market movements, we simply keep you updated on whether you’re on-track to reach your goals. We give you the information you need Conventional wisdom says advisors should proactively contact their customers when the market drops. This can create undue anxiety, and it can even prompt negative behaviors, such as making large unnecessary withdrawals. Instead, we carefully target our emails and in-app notifications, using active engagement as a filter. We show you the potential tax impact of transactions We display the estimated tax impact of an allocation change or withdrawal before you finalize the transaction. This estimate is not only useful information in its own right, but it’s also intended to help drive better investing behavior by reducing the number of unnecessary changes.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Setting and Prioritizing Your Financial Goals  When you have more than one, think in terms of importance, timeline, and the amount you need In 1 minute Saving for big financial goals like retirement doesn’t have to mean letting go of your other goals. But prioritizing them is tough. How are you supposed to weigh something like a distant retirement versus a more immediate financial goal, like a honeymoon? Or a down payment on a home? Start by identifying all of the things you’d like to achieve. They might be big-ticket items you want to buy, experiences you want to have, or expenses you want to be prepared for. Once you’ve named them, estimate how much you’d need to reach each goal, and how soon you’d like to reach them. After you’ve clearly defined the goals you could save for, it’s time to choose which ones matter most to you. You might rank every goal or just narrow the list down to your top five to ten. Then you can calculate how much you’d have to save each month to reach these goals based on your timeline. From there, turn to your budget. Decide how much you can afford to save each month and apply it to your biggest goals first. We highly recommend turning on auto-deposit so you won’t be tempted to stop working toward your goals. Your financial goals don’t have to be set in stone, and neither does your plan. Over time, you may find that you can save more—or that you can’t save as much as you thought. Maybe it’ll take more or less to reach your goal. Or your priorities might change. That’s OK. With Betterment, it’s easy to set, automate, and adjust your goals. In 5 minutes In this guide, we’ll cover: Defining your financial goals Prioritizing your goals Deciding how to allocate your money Adjusting goals as needed Financial goals help you plan for the things you’d like to do with your money, but can’t afford to do right now. Like retiring. Buying a house. Sending your kids to college. Getting that dream car. Remodeling your kitchen. When you know what you want to do, you can estimate how much you need and when you need it. Knowing your goals also helps you choose the right financial accounts, so you can reach them sooner. But what happens when you have multiple financial goals? All of a sudden, it’s harder to know how much to put toward each goal. Thankfully, working toward one goal doesn’t mean you can’t reach another. Here’s how to set and prioritize your financial goals. Define your financial goals If you sit down and think about all of the things you’d like to do with your money, you can probably create a much longer list than you’d expect. Do it. It’s worth taking the time to write down every goal—because you might be forgetting something important! Some of your goals could be as simple as saving up for holiday gifts, as important as building a safety net, or as big as planning for retirement or long-term care. If it’s on your mind, put it on the list.&nbsp; Part of this process should involve estimating how much you’d need to save to reach each goal and when you’d like to reach it. Is it months away? Years? Decades? Will it take hundreds of dollars or hundreds of thousands? Each goal should have a timeline and amount. At Betterment, it’s easy to add this information every time you set up a goal. (And you can change it at any time.) Prioritize what matters to you Your financial goals are yours. This isn’t about what your parents want or what your friends expect from you. Whatever your goals are, prioritize them based on how important they are to you. Remember that ranking your goals doesn’t mean you won’t reach the ones on the bottom. For example, you shouldn’t be afraid to pay down debt and invest at the same time. This is just to help you think about which goals you care about the most. Once you’ve ranked your goals, your list might look like this: Pay off medical debt Build emergency fund Save for retirement Put a down payment on a house Remodel the bathroom You can include as many goals as you want. And in Betterment, you can add each goal to your account, whether you put anything toward it or not. Apply your budget to your list Now that you know how much you need to save, when you need to save it by, and which goals are most important to you, it’s time to see what you can actually accomplish.&nbsp; Using your estimated amount and your timeline (in investing, this is called your “time horizon”), calculate how much you need to save each month to reach each goal. It’s OK if this is more than you can afford to save right now. Putting the numbers in front of you with an ordered list helps you ask questions like, “Can I reach all of these goals on these timelines?” and “Which goal(s) am I willing to delay in order to make progress on the others? If you plan on investing to reach your goal, you should also consider how much you can expect to earn toward these goals with an investment account. Every time you set up a goal in Betterment, we’ll handle this part for you. You can see how achievable your goal is based on how much you put toward it. Automate your financial goals The best way to make sure you reach your goals? Automate them. Don’t make the mistake of putting your goals on pause. Set up recurring deposits for each goal with the amount you’ve set aside for them, and the right amount automatically goes to the right goal. This makes it easy to budget around your goals, and you won’t accidentally miss a month. The strategy is often called “paying yourself first” because you’re putting money toward your highest priorities before spending it on anything else. Want to start working toward your financial goals? Set up a goal with Betterment, and see what you can achieve.

    <p class="item-title">Investing in Your 40s: 4 Financial Goals You Should Prioritize at Mid-Life</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Investing in Your 40s: 4 Financial Goals You Should Prioritize at Mid-Life  In your 40s, your priorities and investing goals become clearer than ever; it’s your mid-life opportunity to get your goals on track. It’s easy to put off planning for the future when the present is so demanding. Unlike in your 20s and 30s when your retirement seemed like a distant event, your 40s are when your financial responsibilities become palpable—now and for retirement. You may be earning more income than ever, so you can benefit far more from planning your taxes carefully. Perhaps you have increased expenses as a result of homeownership. If you have kids, now may also be the time that you’re thinking about or preparing to pay for college tuition. When all of these elements of your financial life converge, they require some thoughtful planning and strategic investing. Consider the following roadmap to planning your investments wisely during these rewarding years of your life. Here are four ways to think about goals you might prepare for. Preparing for Your Next Phase: Four Goals for Your 40s You may have already made a plan for the future. If so, now is a good time to review it and adjust course if necessary. If you haven’t yet made a plan, it’s not too late to get started. Set aside some time to think about your situation and long-term goals. If you’re married or in a relationship, it’s best to include your spouse or partner in identifying your goals. Consider the facts: How much are you making? How much do you spend? Will your spending needs be changing in the near future? (Perhaps you're paying for day carte right now but can plan to redirect that amount towards savings in a few years instead.) How much are you setting aside for savings, investments, and retirement? What will you need in the next five, 10, or 20 years? Work these factors into your short- and long-term financial goals. 1. Pay off high-interest debt. The average variable-rate credit card charges more than 16% a year in interest, so paying off any high-interest credit card debt can boost your financial security more than almost any other financial move you make related to savings or investing. Student loans may also be a high-cost form of debt, especially if you borrowed money when rates were higher. For instance, even federally subsidized loans taken out in the 1990s may carry interest rates as high as 8.25%. If you have a high-interest-rate student loan (say more than 5%), or if you have multiple loans that you’d like to consolidate, you may want to consider refinancing your student debt. These days, lenders offer many options to refinance higher-rate student loans. There’s one form of debt that you don’t necessarily need to repay early, however: your mortgage. This is because mortgage rates are lower than most credit cards and may offer you a tax break. If you itemize deductions, you may be able to subtract mortgage interest from your taxable income. Many people file using the standard deduction, however, so check with your tax professional about what deductions may apply to your situation come tax time. 2. Check that you’re saving enough for retirement. If you’ve had several jobs—which means you might have several retirement or 401(k) plans—now is a good time to organize and check how all of your investments have performed. Betterment can help you accomplish this by allowing you to connect and review your outside accounts. Connecting external accounts allows you to see your wealth in one place and align different accounts to your financial goals. Connecting your accounts in Betterment can also help you see higher investment management fees you might be paying, grab opportunities to invest idle cash, and determine how your portfolios are allocated when we are able to pull that data from other institutions. There could also be several potential benefits of consolidating your various retirement accounts into low-fee IRA accounts at Betterment. Because it’s much easier to get on track in your 40s than in your 50s since you have more time to invest, you should also check in on the advice personalized for you in a Betterment retirement goal. Creating a Retirement goal at Betterment allows you to build a customized retirement plan to help you understand how much you’ll need to save for retirement based on when and where you plan on retiring. The plan also considers current and future income—including Social Security income—as well as your 401(k) accounts and other savings. Your plan updates regularly, and when you connect all of your outside accounts, it provides even more personalized retirement guidance. 3. Optimize your taxes. In your 40s, you’re likely to be earning more than earlier in your career–which may put you in a higher tax bracket. Review your tax situation to help make sure you are keeping as much of your hard-earned income as you can. Determine if you should be investing in a Roth (after-tax contribution) or traditional (pre-tax contribution) employer plan option, or an IRA. These days, more than half of employer-sponsored plans like 401(k)s offer a Roth option, and unlike Roth IRAs, it’s not limited by a maximum income threshold. The optimal choice usually depends on your current income versus your expected income in retirement. If your income is higher now than you expect it to be in retirement, it’s generally better to use a traditional 401(k) and take the tax deduction. If your income is similar or less than what you expect in retirement, you should consider choosing a Roth if available. Those without employer plans can generally take traditional IRA deductions no matter what their taxable income is (as long as your spouse doesn’t have one, either). You can use Betterment’s 401(k) vs. IRA calculator to help decide which one you should be contributing to, or if you’re a Betterment customer, consult your Retirement Goal’s “How To Save” section, after ensuring that you have connected any external retirement accounts. You’ll also want to make sure you take advantage of all the tax credits and deductions that may be available to you. For instance, if you work and pay for childcare, you may be eligible for a dependent care tax credit. Depending on your income, this credit may be worth anywhere from 20% to 35% of what you spend on childcare, and the expenses are capped at $3,000 for one qualifying individual, and $6,000 for two qualifying individuals. Check also to see whether your company offers tax-free transportation benefits—including subway or bus passes or commuter parking. The value of these benefits isn’t included in your taxable income, so you can save money. You can also save money on a pre-tax basis by contributing to a Health Savings Account (HSA) or Flexible Spending Account (FSA). You might not think using these accounts is worth the time, but for a couple making $100k in taxable income per year, you should receive a 29.65% return on investment in the federal/social security/medicare income tax break.1&nbsp; You may not have that much in expenses, but even if you only pay $200 a month for commuter parking and/or transportation passes and only contribute $500 annually to your FSA, paying those costs pre-tax is the equivalent to paying yourself over $850 in tax savings - it’s worth the time it takes to sign up!&nbsp; Health Saving Accounts (HSA) Health savings accounts (HSAs) are like personal savings accounts, but the money in them is used to pay for health care expenses. Only you—not your employer or insurance company—own and control the money in your HSA. The money you deposit into the account is not taxed. To be eligible to open an HSA, you must have a special type of health insurance called a high-deductible plan. Your 401(k) may be tied to your employer, however your HSA is not. As long as your health plan meets the deductible requirement and permits you to open an HSA, and you’re not receiving Medicare benefits or claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return, you can open one with various HSA “administrators” or “custodians” such as banks, credit unions, insurance companies, and other financial institutions. You can withdraw the funds tax-free at any time for qualified medical expenses. Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) A Flexible Spending Account (FSA) is a special account that can be used to save for certain out-of-pocket health care costs. You don’t pay taxes on this money—this is a tax-favored program that some employers offer to their employees. If you have an FSA, remember that in most cases your spending allowance does not carry over from year-to-year. It’s important to find out whether your employer offers a grace period into the next year (typically through mid-March) to spend down your account. Before you waste your tax-free savings on eyeglasses, check what you can buy with FSA money—with and without a prescription. Any unused funds will be forfeited, so it’s a good idea to use up what you can. If you find yourself with more than you can spend, then you might want to adjust how much you’re allocating to your FSA. 4. If you have children, start saving for college—just don’t shortchange your retirement to do it. If you have children, you may already be paying for their college tuition, or at least preparing to pay for it. For 2020-2021, the average annual costs of college tuition and fees in the United States were $10,560 for in-state public colleges, $27,020 for out-of-state public colleges, and $37,650 for private education, according to the College Board. This doesn’t include the cost of room and board, so you can see why paying for college is something many people have to plan strategically for. Kids grow up fast, so if you haven’t started thinking about college costs, here’s some information to get started. According to the College Board’s College Cost Calculator, today’s fifth grader today will need approximately $268,8832 to graduate from an average four-year private college by the year 2033. Scholarships, grants and federal loans can help, but many parents feel it is up to them to make sure that their kids can get the education they deserve. It is a mistake to save for your kids’ college costs while neglecting your own financial security. Plenty of parents submit a final tuition payment only to realize that they’ve saved nothing for retirement—without any time left to save more. It is a mistake to save for your kids’ college costs while neglecting your own financial security. So, first things first, make sure you’re saving enough for your own retirement. Then if you have money left over, think about tax-deferred college savings plans, such as 529 plans. A 529—named for the section of the tax code that allows for them—can be a great way to save for college because earnings are tax-free if used for qualified education expenses. Some states even allow you to deduct contributions from your state income tax, if you use your state’s plan. (While each state has its own plan, you can use any state’s plan, no matter where your child will go to college.) An alternative is to put money away in your own taxable savings accounts. Some investors prefer this method since it gives them more control over the money if things change, and may be more beneficial for financial aid. Your 40s are all about taking stock of how far you’ve come, re-adjusting your priorities, and getting ready for the next phase of life. By working on your financial goals now, you can gain peace of mind that allows you to concentrate on important things like family, friends, work, and the way you want to spend this rewarding decade of your life.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Investing in Your 30s: 3 Goals You Should Set Today  It’s never too early or too late to start investing for a better future. Here’s what you need to know about investing in your 30s. In your 30s, your finances get real. Your income may have increased significantly since your first job. You might have investments, stock compensation, or a small business. You may be using or have access to different kinds of financial accounts (e.g. 401(k), IRA, Roth IRA, HSA, 529, UTMA). In this decade of your life, chances are you’ll get married, and even start a family. Even if you’ve taken this complexity in stride, it’s good to take a step back to review where you are and where you want to go. This review of your plan (or reminder to create a plan) is essential to setting up your financial situation for future decades of financial success. Don’t Delay Creating A Plan: Three Goals For Your 30s As always, the best thing to do is start with your financial goals. Keep in mind that goals change through time, and this review is an important step to make updates based on where you are now. If you don’t have any goals yet, or need some guidance on which investing objectives might be important for you, here are three to consider. Emergency Fund Sometimes your plan doesn’t go as planned, and having an adequate emergency fund can help ensure those hiccups don’t affect the rest of your goals. An emergency fund (at Betterment, we call it a Safety Net) should contain enough money to cover your basic expenses for a minimum of three to six months. You may need more than that estimate depending on your career, which may or may not be one in which finding new work happens quickly. Also, depending on how much risk you want to take with these funds, you may need a buffer on top of that amount. Read more about how to calculate your target amount, or follow this simple formula: Monthly Expenditures x Re-Employment Period = Baseline Safety Net Amount As you review your goals, make sure you have established a safety net account. Good options for this include a high-yield cash account like Betterment Cash Reserve, or a Betterment Safety Net. Then, make sure you have enough saved in that account (or are regularly saving into it to build up the balance). Retirement Most people don’t want to work forever. Even if you enjoy your work, you’ll likely work less as you age, presumably reducing your income. To maintain your standard of living, or spend more on travel, hobbies or grandkids, you’ll need to spend from savings. Saving for your retirement early in your career—especially in your 30s–is essential. Thanks to medical improvements and healthier living, we are living longer in retirement, which means we need to save even more. Luckily, you have a secret weapon—compounding—but you have to use it. Compounding can be simply understood as “interest earning interest,”a snowball effect that can build your account balance more quickly over time. The earlier you start saving, the more time you have, and the more compounding can work for you. In your goal review, you’ll want to make sure you are on track to retire according to your plan, and make savings adjustments if not. You’ll also want to make sure you are using the best retirement accounts for your current financial situation, such as your workplace retirement plan, an IRA, or a Roth IRA. Your household income, tax rate, future tax rate and availability of accounts for you and your spouse will determine what is best for you. Use Betterment’s Retirement Planner, which helps answer all of these questions. Also, if you’ve changed jobs, make sure you are not leaving your retirement savings behind, especially if it has high fees. Often, consolidating your old 401(k)s and IRAs into one account can make it easier to manage, and might even reduce your costs. You can consolidate retirement accounts tax-free with a rollover. If you have questions about your plan or the results using our tools, consider getting help from an expert through our Advice Packages. Major Purchases A wedding, a house, a big trip, or college for your kids. Each of these goals has a different amount needed, and a different time horizon. Our goal-based savings advice can help you figure out how to invest and how much to save each month to achieve them. Take the chance in your goal review to decide which of these goals is most important to you, and make sure you set them up as goals in your Betterment account. Our goal features allow you to see, track, and manage each goal, even if the savings aren’t at Betterment.

    <p class="item-title">Investing in Your 20s: 4 Major Financial Questions Answered</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Investing in Your 20s: 4 Major Financial Questions Answered  When you're in your 20s, you may be starting to invest or you might have some existing assets you need to take better care of. Pay attention to these major issues. For most of us, our 20s is the first decade of life where investing might become a priority. You may have just graduated college, and having landed your first few full-time jobs, you’re starting to get serious about putting your money to work. More likely than not, you’re motivated and eager to start forging your financial future. Unfortunately, eagerness alone isn’t enough to be a successful investor. Once you make the decision to start investing, and you’ve done a bit of research, dozens of new questions emerge. Questions like, “Should I invest or pay down debt?” or “What should I do to start a nest egg?” In this article, we’ll cover the top four questions we hear from investors in their twenties that we believe are important questions to be asking—and answering. “Should I invest aggressively just because I’m young?” “Should I pay down my debts or start investing?” “Should I contribute to a Roth or Traditional retirement account?” “How long should it take to see results?” Let’s explore these to help you develop a clearer path through your 20s. 1. “Should I invest aggressively just because I’m young?” Young investors often hear that they should invest aggressively because they “have time on their side.” That usually means investing in a high percentage of stocks and a small percentage of bonds or cash. While the logic is sound, it’s really only half of the story. And the half that is missing is the most important part: the foundation of your finances. The portion of your money that is for long-term goals, such as retirement, should most likely be invested aggressively. But in your twenties you have other financial goals besides just retirement. Let’s look at some common goals that should not have aggressive, high risk investments just because you’re young. A safety net. It’s extremely important to build up an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of your expenses. We usually recommend your safety net should have a portfolio allocation of no more than 40% stocks. Wedding costs. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median age of a first marriage for men is 29, and for women, it’s 27. You don’t want to have to delay matrimony just because the stock market took a dip, so money set aside for these goals should also probably be invested conservatively. A home down payment. The median age for purchasing a first home is age 32, according to the New York Times. That means most people should start saving for that house in their twenties. When saving for a relatively short-term goal—especially one as important as your first home—it likely doesn’t make sense to invest very aggressively. So how should you invest for these shorter-term goals? If you plan on keeping your savings in cash, make sure your money is working for you. Consider using a&nbsp;cash account like Cash Reserve, which could earn a higher rate than traditional savings accounts. If you want to invest your money, you should separate your savings into different buckets for each goal, and invest each bucket according to its time horizon. An example looks like this. The above graph is Betterment’s recommendation for how stock-to-bond allocations should change over time&nbsp;for a major purchase goal. And don’t forget to adjust your risk as your goal gets closer—or if you use Betterment, we’ll adjust your risk automatically for you. 2. “Should I pay down my debts or start investing?” The right risk level for your investments depends not just on your age, but on the purpose of that particular bucket of money. But should you even be investing in the first place? Or, would it be better to focus on paying down debt? According to Northwestern Mutual’s 2018 Planning &amp; Progress Study, millennials have an average of $36,000 in debt, mainly from student loans and credit cards. In some cases, paying down debt should be prioritized over investing, but that’s not always the case. Here’s one example: “Should I pay down a 4.5% mortgage or contribute to my 401(k) to get a 100% employer match?” Mathematically, the employer match is usually the right move. The return on a 100% employer match is usually better than saving 4.5% by paying extra on your mortgage if you’re planning to pay the same amount for either option. It comes down to what is the most optimal use of your next dollar. We've discussed the topic in more detail previously, but the quick summary is that, when deciding to pay off debt or invest, use this prioritized framework: Always make your minimum debt payments on time. Maximise the match in your employer-sponsored retirement plan. Pay off high-cost debt (anything 5%-6% or greater). Build your safety net. Save for retirement. Save for your other goals (home purchase, kid’s college). Read more about investing and paying off debt. 3. “Should I contribute to a Roth or Traditional retirement account?” Speaking of employer matches in your retirement account, which type of retirement account is best for you? Should you choose a Roth retirement account (e.g. Roth 401(k), Roth IRA) in your twenties? Or should you use a traditional account? As a quick refresher, here’s how Roth and traditional retirement accounts generally work: Traditional: Contributions to these accounts are usually pre-tax. In exchange for this upfront tax break, you usually must pay taxes on all future withdrawals. Roth: Contributions to these accounts are generally after-tax. Instead of getting a tax break today, all of the future earnings and qualified withdrawals will be tax-free. So you can’t avoid paying taxes, but at least you can choose when you pay them. Either now when you make the contribution, or in the future when you make the withdrawal. As a general rule: If your current tax bracket is higher than your expected tax bracket in retirement, you should choose the Traditional option. If your current tax bracket is the same or lower than your expected tax bracket in retirement, you should choose the Roth option. The good news is that Betterment’s retirement planning tool can do this all for you and recommend which is likely best for your situation. We estimate your current and future tax bracket, and even factor in additional factors like employer matches, fees and even your spouse’s accounts, if applicable. 4. “How long should it take to see investing results?” Humans are wired to seek immediate gratification. We want to see results and we want them fast. The investments we choose are no different. We want to see our money grow, even double or triple as fast as possible! We are always taught of the magic of compound interest, and how if you save $x amount over time, you’ll have so much money by the time you retire. That is great for initial motivation, but it’s important to understand that most of that growth happens later in life. In fact very little growth occurs while you are just starting. The graph below shows what happens over 30 years if you save $250/month in today’s dollars and earn a 7% rate of return. By the end you’ll have over $372,000! But it’s not until year 5 that you would earn more money than you contributed that year. And it would take 18 years for the total earnings in your account to be larger than your total contributions. How Compounding Works: Contributions vs. Future Earnings The figure shows a hypothetical example of compounding, based on a $3,000 annual contribution over 30 years with an assumed growth rate of 7%, compounded each year. This example is hypothetical and illustrates the general pattern of how compounding seems to work in the short term versus the long term. This figure is not based on or related to any Betterment portfolio or offering. The point is it can take time to see the fruits of your investing labor. That’s entirely normal. But don’t let that discourage you. Some things you can do early on to help are to make your saving automatic and reduce your fees. Both of these things will help you save more and make your money work harder. Use Your 20s To Your Advantage Your 20s are an important time in your financial life. It is the decade where you can build a strong foundation for decades to come. Whether that’s choosing the proper risk level for your goals, deciding to pay down debt or invest, or selecting the right retirement accounts. Making the right decisions now can save you the headache of having to correct these things later. Lastly, remember to stay the course. It can take time to see the type of growth you want in your account.

    <p class="item-title">How I Managed My Financial Goals When I Got Married</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      How I Managed My Financial Goals When I Got Married  There are many different ways to manage money as a couple. The key is to have open communication, sooner rather than later. A few months before the wedding, one of my groomsmen asked me if I had thought about how my fiancée and I would combine finances. It sparked an interesting conversation, as he and I then realized we had very different views on the best way to manage money as a couple. Of course, every relationship is different and there is no silver bullet for reducing money-related stress within a partnership. However, we consider ourselves lucky to have found a system that works well for us early on. After all, a study found that financial problems were cited as a cause for the breakdown of relationships by at least one of the partners in 56% of divorced couples — a sobering statistic to be sure. In this article, I’ll share some of the personal finance practices that worked well for my wife and me: proactive budgeting, allocating every dollar in our budget to a goal, and speaking openly and often about our financial priorities. Here’s what worked for us: We quickly decided to join our finances. My wife and I met in college. After a few months of dating, we both knew we were in the relationship for the long haul and our approach to finances changed radically. Even before we moved in together, we made it a point to foster a philosophy of “what’s mine is yours.” One common way couples manage their finances is to set up a joint account from which all bills are paid, and each partner keeps a separate account for “mine” and “your” spending. In contrast, we approached budgeting in almost the exact opposite way— every expense was “ours,” and we also set our budgeting goals together. One month I might have needed a suit for a job interview and another month she might have needed some repairs done to her car. Either way, we considered both of these expenses as shared, and didn’t keep track of who paid for what. Of course, this approach might have complicated things if our relationship had not turned out as well as it had. If we had broken up a few months into our relationship, one of us may have felt cheated by the fact that more expenses were paid for by their account. However, I credit our approach to finances as part of the reason why our relationship was so solid in the first place. I don’t think my wife and I have ever had an argument about our finances, and by setting common goals and budgets early on, we were able to avoid one of the largest relationship stressors. 3 Tips For Managing Joint Finances Our strategy for managing finances has remained mostly the same since our college days. For budgeting, we use the envelope system, which relies on giving all of your cash a purpose. Every cent that flows into one of our accounts is earmarked for a specific need. One very tedious way of following this technique is to keep all your money in cash, and physically store it inside separately labelled envelopes (hence the name). If the grocery envelope has $100 on it, then that’s your budget for groceries until you have more cash inflow to distribute among your envelopes. Of course, you can simplify this system by having software track your cash digitally. 1. Develop a proactive vs. reactive budget. First, our budget is proactive rather than reactive. Many popular budgeting apps aggregate your transactions and let you see how much money was already spent on what, but they don’t actually help you plan out your future goals. We use the app YNAB, though a simple spreadsheet could get you most of the way there. Keeping track of your spending in such detail may sound taxing, but it has many benefits. By giving every dollar a job, we know what our spending will look like ahead of time, and we can focus on saving for the long-term. 2. Adopt the “envelope” system. Secondly, the envelope system helps you smooth out seasonal spending patterns over time. For example, we have a dedicated category for Christmas gifts to which we allocate a few dollars every month. Though buying holiday gifts may not seem top of mind in February, allocating to that category year round means that once December rolls around, we have a full “digital envelope” of cash solely dedicated to buying gifts. Though the physical spending may vary month-to-month, the amount we contribute to each category is very steady. I think of this as almost like a self-sponsored credit card, where we have low monthly payments every month, instead of a large payment all at once. 3. Speak openly and frequently about future priorities. Thirdly, taking a proactive approach to budgeting means that my wife and I regularly have conversations about our hopes and priorities for our finances. A budget that summarizes what you spent last month will do very little to make you think about your future goals, but our budget has categories for things like future vacations, a home-purchase, and school fees for children we don’t even have yet. Strange as it sounds, I think we’ve had some of the most enriching conversations of our relationship while doing our budgeting. There is no one-size-fits all solution for how to manage finances as a couple. Indeed, even initiating the conversation about managing money can be daunting. Yet, since communication is key, I remain a firm believer that early, open conversations about what works best for you and your partner are not only critical for the relationship but also an incredible opportunity to work towards your dreams, together. Whether you choose a proactive budget or a reactive budget, whether you begin merging your finances sooner or later (or at all), and whether you review and adjust your approach often or occasionally, take the fear out of talking money. More than anything, budgeting together is an opportunity to discuss what is most important to you—a chance to start on a path towards goals for which you are excited to reach together. Some might say those are the very best parts of a relationship.

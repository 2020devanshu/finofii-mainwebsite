      How Robo-Advisors Guide Your Investing  Here’s everything you need to know In 10 seconds A robo-advisor is a digital investment platform. Using algorithms, it automatically manages your investments according to your goals. In 1 minute Robo-advisors like Betterment use formulas to make smart investment decisions, lowering your cost and seeking to reduce human error in comparison to traditional financial advisors. This approach can give you some unique advantages. Here are the five principles that drive robo-advisors’ approach to investing. Personalization. You’re the most important part of the equation. We adjust our algorithms to fit your goals and circumstances. Automation and discipline. Avoid some common investor mistakes by automating your deposits and resisting the urge to meddle with your portfolio. Robo-advisors aim to make this easy, with the hope that you can reach your goals sooner and keep more in your pocket. Diversification. Robo-advisors set up your portfolio for long-term success by investing in a wide range of assets. Diversification prevents you from being overly exposed to concentrated risks. Lower fees and costs. Algorithms don’t have salaries. It takes a lot less overhead to automate portfolio management.&nbsp; Manage taxes. Taxes are often unavoidable. But with savvy investment moves, you may be able to offset them. Robo-advisors like Betterment can do this automatically if you choose, with features like Tax Loss Harvesting.&nbsp; If you have more time, we can unpack these principles in more detail. In 5 minutes In this article, we’ll: Explain what robo-advisors are Walk you through our five principles of investing What are robo-advisors? A robo-advisor is basically an automated financial advisor. Just like a human financial advisor, a robo-advisor gives recommendations based on your personal financial goals and circumstances. But instead of having a human manage your investment portfolio, a robo-advisor uses algorithms designed to find the optimal investment approach and maximize your returns. It’s technology that helps you manage your money. You can have as much or as little responsibility as you like. The robo-advisor gives you the data-driven insights you need to make wise choices or fully automate your investments. The biggest difference from a human financial advisor? A robo-advisor can cost you far less.&nbsp; Bottom line: Robo-advisors are able to give you similar performance to a financial advisor, but without the steep fees. So you can keep more of what your investments earn. So what guides a robo-advisor’s recommendations? There are five key principles.&nbsp; 1. Personalization We want you to reach your financial goals. So, we start by learning about you. What do you want to achieve? How soon do you want to achieve it? The right investment depends on how much you need to earn and how much time you have to earn it.&nbsp; Not sure how much you need to reach your goal? Or how much you can even invest? We can help with that, too. We explore how things like your income, where you live, and your tax bracket affect what your goal looks like and how fast you can reach it. The result is clear, achievable goals that fit your life and help you get the most from your accounts. 2. Automation and discipline With automatic deposits and decisions based on algorithms, it’s easy to make steady progress toward your goals. It’s also easier to avoid common investor mistakes. Your portfolio will likely experience short-term losses here and there. It’s part of investing. And your reactions to these losses can have a huge impact on your long-term success. You can’t let emotions get in the way of your goals. By automating your portfolio and staying disciplined about investing, you’re better equipped to ride out the short-term losses and enjoy long-term gains. 3. Diversification We’re not here to help you pick the perfect stock. Investing in a single financial asset leaves you vulnerable to that asset’s risks. With a single stock, you could lose everything if a company goes bankrupt, performs poorly, or gets some bad press.&nbsp; Instead, we help you build a well-diversified portfolio. Diversification spreads your investments across assets, asset classes, and even markets, lowering your overall risk. We automatically diversify your portfolio based on your goals and desires.&nbsp; Through socially responsible investing (SRI), you can even diversify your portfolio according to your values.&nbsp; Want to invest in environmentally-conscious companies? Done. How about businesses that demonstrate a commitment to social values? Check. Want to have the broadest positive impact you can? Easy. We have three SRI portfolios to choose from. Note that higher bond allocations in your SRI portfolio decrease the percentage attributable to socially responsible ETFs. However you diversify, this strategy helps you make steady progress toward your goal.&nbsp; 4. Lower fees and costs A robo-advisor can save you a lot of money in fees and ongoing costs. We remove human advisors from the equation—unless you want them. When you have Assets Under Management (AUM) with a robo-advisor, the fees are typically a fraction of what you’d pay for a financial advisor. Our fees are just 0.25% annually. With a financial advisor, you’re looking at more like 1% to 2%. And since everything is based on algorithms, you won’t pay extra for rebalancing and making other changes to your portfolio. 5. Manage taxes Taxes are one of the trickiest parts of investing. Sell for a profit at the wrong time, and you’ll be on the hook for short-term capital gains taxes. Sell the right asset for a loss at the right time, and you can offset taxes through tax-loss harvesting. Managing taxes wisely helps keep your gains consistent and maximize what you get to keep. With a robo-advisor like Betterment, this can happen automatically if you elect this feature. The algorithm optimizes your portfolio to try and keep you from being hit hard by taxes. A financial advisor can do this too, but will usually charge an additional fee. Put your financial goals on cruise control. Investing doesn’t have to be difficult. And reaching your financial goals doesn’t have to take all your time and attention. With a robo-advisor and a smart strategy, you can create your plan and let the algorithms do the rest.

      Betterment’s Model for Financial Advice: An Overview  Saving enough, choosing the right accounts, deciding when you can buy a house or when to retire—all of these are essential decisions before you build an optimal portfolio. TABLE OF CONTENTS How Betterment Helps You Plan We Plan Despite the Future’s Uncertainty How We Estimate Market Performance How We Estimate Future Tax Rates How We Estimate Inflation Our Commitment to You: Constant Improvement Model Release Notes and Assumption Updates When it comes to investing, it’s easy to get lost in a myriad of decisions about strategies, diversification, investment costs, or funds to buy, to name a few. These decisions are important, but their apparent complexity can obscure an even more important question: What are you trying to accomplish with your portfolio? At Betterment, we deliver easy-to-use financial planning tools that help you design a plan to achieve your financial goals. And to that end, we continually update the tools we provide—factoring in new possible scenarios and redeveloping our assumptions as we learn about the future. In this article, we’ll outline how our model works and provide a list of updates we’ve made. Planning for your future with financial goals Establishing financial goals, and a plan to achieve them, is critical. This is why Betterment has been a goal-based investing service since the beginning. Goals help root your thinking about the future, and they have well-documented behavioral benefits. Your situation can change, as can your goals, so it’s essential to have flexibility in your plan, and the ability to answer key “what-if” questions. Goals help enable a financial advisor—automated or human—to give you quality advice, which can add significant value beyond the simple returns of a portfolio. How Betterment helps you plan Betterment’s online financial planning tools are designed to make it easy to set up a personalized, flexible, easy-to-track plan. Starting in our signup process, you establish your first goal, and can add other goals at any time once signed up. A goal is a future spending need, and will fall into one of four categories, each with different attributes and investing advice. These categories are: Safety Net Major Purchase Retirement General Investing Once you choose a category, you provide details about the goal so that we can recommend a portfolio, a level of risk, and how to save (or withdraw, if in retirement) to help achieve the goal. Then you can use our tools to see how a one-time deposit, recurring deposits, and the time horizon change how you can achieve your goal. For more complex goals like retirement, our built-in retirement planning advice factors in other variables, such as the impact of Social Security, other income streams like rental real estate, as well as future spending, tax rates, and inflation. Here are some examples of questions you can start to answer with Betterment’s financial planning tools: How much do I need to save to put a downpayment on a house in five years? When can I retire? Can I retire early? How much should I save to retire at age X? What if I save more or less than that? How can a poor market affect my savings plan or retirement? What if Social Security isn’t around? How much do I have to save then? Should I use my 401(k) or an IRA? Should I use a Roth IRA / 401(k)? How much should I save in my Safety Net? If I save X per month, what can it be worth in 10 years? Our tools help provide guidance on all of these questions and more. And we think they are better than most financial planning tools for two key reasons: We keep your balance up-to-date at a high frequency, so you know where you stand and what to do next. Changes are simple to make and applied in real time, so you can update your goals and form a better game plan. We plan despite the future’s uncertainty The key challenge in planning for the future is that nobody can truly forecast the future. You can’t be sure how or when your situation will change, and we can never predict how external factors like shifting markets, inflation, or tax rates will change. However, as the statistician George Box once said, “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” As investors, our lack of ability to know the future should not mean we give up and stop planning. Instead, we should aim to identify the “useful” models Box was referring to—tools that factor in potential variability and allow you to envision how various changes are likely to affect your plan. Tools like these help you understand the range of potential outcomes, which will better inform the decisions you make today. For example, if financial markets (and thus your portfolio) perform worse than the average we expect (a “poor market” scenario), your savings may be wholly inadequate to meet your spending needs in retirement. To help avoid this result, you could save more today to increase your projected future income, even if a poor market occurs. If you didn’t know this information in advance, it would be too late to adjust if a poor market scenario did occur. How we estimate market performance One of the key estimates about the future we make is how your portfolio will perform in the future. As you can see from the blue shading on our Advice tab in Figure 1, there is a wide range of potential portfolio growth results, depending on if the market performs poorly, or well over the time horizon of the goal. Figure 1: Setting a major purchase goal to buy a Tesla Model S using Betterment There are many ways to estimate future returns of a portfolio. The simplest way, used by many financial calculators, is to assume a constant average return which is typically based on historical returns of a typical benchmark, like the S&amp;P 500 index. A common estimate is 7% for U.S. stocks. While there may be benefits to simple assumptions, this one has several problems: You are not usually invested exactly like that benchmark. For example, you might hold both stocks and bonds. Different mixes of these assets in your portfolio will have different ranges of outcomes. You probably have multiple financial goals, with different time horizons. For example, your retirement account should not be invested the same was as an education fund for your kids, because one is based on spending in (say) 30 years, the other in 15 years. Thus you may hold different risk portfolios for each goal which should not have the same returns assumption. Using a historical estimate is very sensitive to the time horizon used to calculate it. Betterment makes several improvements on this method to help make our estimates more accurate: We use a return estimate for the specific portfolio you select, for each goal. For example, our estimate for a 90% stock portfolio is different than that of a 85% stock portfolio. This estimate is based on the specific asset classes that you actually hold. We consider volatility in our returns estimates. This allows us to produce the range of returns you see on the Advice tab, and also allows configuring the chance of success of our models. For example, our savings estimates assume a somewhat conservative 40th percentile outcome (60% chance of success) rather than the simple average (a 50% chance of success). The return we assume is based on risk-free rate and an asset premium. The “risk free rate” (which is the return a risk-free asset such as a U.S. Treasury bill will return), and an equity (or bond) “risk premium” or excess return, which is how much we expect risky assets like stocks and bonds to return in addition to this risk-free rate. We assume risk-free returns vary over time. You probably know that interest rates (set by the Fed via it’s U.S. Treasury buying and selling program) are low right now, and most economists expect them to rise. The returns of each stock or bond fund in your portfolio are expected to be in addition to the safe or “risk-free” Treasury rates. So when rates rise, so should our expectations of your returns. Our projections assume these will increase from their low now to more normal rates in the future. (Learn more about this) Also, we make the typical assumption that longer term treasuries have higher returns than short term, due to the added interest rate risk they contain. How we estimate future tax rates Just like how no one can predict the outcome of a presidential election, we can’t predict what tax rates in the future will be. However, we are pretty sure that certain incomes and account types will be subject to some tax, so good planning tools like Betterment’s factor in some adjustment for taxes. This is most relevant in retirement planning, where taxes affect the account types you might use (e.g., IRA or Roth IRA) and your current and future income. How we incorporate tax rate estimates to our retirement planning advice: We use the latest federal tax data available. For federal taxes, these are known in advance and updated every Jan. 1. For state tax rates, this data is harder to come by, and we update them as soon as reasonably possible. Historically that is six to 12 months into the year. For example, given it’s early in 2018, we are still using 2017 state tax rates. Tax bracket ranges are typically adjusted for inflation, so we assume that inflation by itself will not cause major changes to tax rate assumptions. Your income will be different in the future, which affects your tax rate. We account for income increases due to inflation and typical salary growth (see our full retirement planning methodology for more information). We use these factors to estimate what your future tax rate might be. We allow tax deduction and dependent overrides, which can affect your personal rate. How we estimate inflation Like tax rates, we cannot know how inflation will change through time. There are certain known historical ranges and understood targets set by fiscal policy. The most important thing is to factor in some inflation, especially for long-term goals like retirement, because we know it won’t be zero. Good tools will always do this, even if assumptions vary from tool to tool. At Betterment, by default we currently assume a 2% inflation rate in our retirement planning advice and in our safe withdrawal advice, which is what the Fed currently targets. You can override this value in Edit Assumptions if you have a different view. Read more about our assumption on inflation. Inflation: 12-Month Average Consumer Price Index Growth Figure 2:&nbsp;Inflation through time, as shown by the Consumer Price Index for all consumers and all items. Seasonally adjusted.&nbsp;Data Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data Our commitment to you: constant improvement Just as you should review your goals and their status periodically, our commitment to you is to keep our tools updated and as forward-thinking as possible. Our Investment Committee and team of analysts periodically review our economic, tax, and returns assumptions, as well as make improvements to the capabilities of our tools. For example, we make regular updates to our risk-free rates, especially now that rates have started to move upward. An example of how we invest in our tools is the release of RetireGuide in 2015, which was the first time we factored Social Security, inflation, and taxes into our retirement calculations. These ongoing improvements, as well as actual performance of your account, can cause our recommendations to vary, so we recommend reviewing your goals and status at least once per year. In order to be transparent about the changes we make, we keep a log of all historical changes to our models. You can also review our Projections Methodology and methodology for more model details and limitations.

      How Betterment’s Tech Helps You Manage Your Money  Our human experts harness the power of technology to help you reach your financial goals. Here’s how. When you’re trying to make the most of your money and plan for the future, financial advisors are really helpful. But there are some things humans simply can’t do as well as algorithms. And investing is an area where automation and digital tools can help improve your outcomes and make advanced strategies more accessible. Here at Betterment, we’re all about using technology—with human experts at the helm—to manage your money smarter and help you meet your financial goals. In this guide, we’ll Explore the concept of a “robo-advisor” Talk about Betterment’s human approach to technology Share how we help your investing avoid idle cash Share how our tech helps you plan for the future Show how you can access additional advice A quick primer on the rise of robo-advisors There’s a word for the investment firms who first used technology in new and exciting ways in the service of everyday investors: robo-advisors. By letting their human experts and technology do what each does best, robo-advisors provide some key benefits: Optimized time.Robo-advisors use algorithms and automation to do all the busy work, optimizing your investments faster than a human can. The result: you spend less time managing your finances and more time enjoying your life. Lower fees.Because of their efficiency, robo-advisors cost less to operate, which translates to savings for you. While the specific fees vary from one robo-advisor to the next, they all tend to be a fraction of what it costs to work with a traditional investment manager. Lower barriers to entry.Almost anyone with Internet access can use a robo-advisor. No special expertise required. And you don’t need a big minimum investment to get started. Personalized recommendations.Robo-advisors help you focus on your specific reasons for saving, adjusting your risk based on your timeline and target amount. Robo-advisors do the heavy lifting behind the scenes, managing all the data analysis and adapting investment expertise to fit your circumstances. All you need to do is fill in the gaps with details about your financial goals. If you have the time to research, implement and routinely manage your own investment strategy, you still can, but you don’t have to. That’s the beauty of working with a robo-advisor. The experience is as hands-on as you want it to be. Or you can relax in the knowledge your investments are in good hands, so you can simply live your life. How we combine human expertise with technology Automation is what we’re known for. But our team of financial experts is our secret sauce. They research, prototype, and implement all the advice and activity that you see in your account. Our algorithms and tools are built on the expertise of traders, quantitative researchers, tax experts, CFP® professionals, behavioral scientists, and more. Then we use technology to help accurately and consistently execute your investment strategy. Our automated processes manage your portfolio, monitoring for opportunities to rebalance and then rebalancing once accounts cross a $50 threshold if it drifts too far from your target allocation, and executing any tax strategies you’ve enabled. Technology also lets us put all of your deposits to work and avoid idle cash. Keep reading for more on that. How we automate to help you avoid the cost of idle cash Cash is an essential part of our financial lives. You can’t pay for this week’s groceries with stock, after all. And it may reassure you to keep your emergency fund in cash, although we’d politely point out you have other options to consider there. But there’s little benefit to letting cash sit idle in your investing accounts. That’s because it’s missing out on potential market returns, while at the same time losing value in times of inflation, which is most times. This double whammy can mean serious setbacks in achieving long-term investing success. That’s why we use technology to invest every penny of yours put toward a portfolio of ETFs. Here’s how: We automatically reinvest the dividends your investments pay out. Dividends are the cash earnings companies regularly distribute to shareholders. We purchase fractions of shares on your behalf, meaning if you deposit enough money to purchase 2 ⅔ shares of an ETF, that’s exactly how many shares you’ll get. For years, many investing firms would round up or down to the nearest whole share and leave the remaining cash idle in your account. Speaking of other brokerage firms, you may still have investing accounts with some. So what’s an investor to do in that case? Well, if you connect these external accounts to Betterment, we can highlight each of your external portfolio’s total idle cash. We hope this information is a starting point that helps you decide whether it’s worth it to transfer that money to a different firm. How we help you plan for the future Nobody knows the future. And that makes financial planning tough. Your situation can change at any time. And we can’t predict how external factors like markets, inflation, or tax rates may shift. But that doesn’t mean you should give up and stop planning. Our tools and advice can help you see how various changes could affect your goals. We show you a range of potential outcomes so you can make more informed decisions. We estimate how market performance may affect your investments Financial experts use many different methods to estimate future returns of a portfolio. Many financial calculators simply assume a constant average return. This is usually based on historical returns of a benchmark, like the S&amp;P 500 index. But there are several problems with assumptions like this: You aren’t usually invested exactly like the benchmark. Different mixes of stocks and bonds or other assets in your portfolio will result in different ranges of outcomes. You probably have multiple financial goals, each with their own time horizons. The different risk allocations for each goal shouldn’t have the same returns assumption. Assumptions based on a historical estimate are sensitive to the time horizon used to calculate them. At Betterment, we’ve made three improvements to this method to make more accurate estimates: We use a return estimate for the specific portfolio you select for each goal. For example, our estimate for a 90% stock portfolio is different from our estimate for an 85% stock portfolio. Each is based on the asset classes you actually hold. We factor market volatility into our estimates. This produces the range of returns you see on the goal forecaster. For example, our savings estimates assume a somewhat conservative 40th percentile outcome (60% chance of success) rather than the simple average (50% chance of success). We assume that a risk-free component of expected returns can vary over time. When interest rates rise (or fall), so should your expected returns. We consider the impact of tax rates We may not be able to predict future tax rates, but we can be pretty sure that certain incomes and account types will be subject to some taxes. This becomes especially relevant in retirement planning, where taxes affect which account types are most valuable to you (such as a traditional IRA or Roth IRA) and your current and future income. Here’s how we estimate tax rates for your accounts: We use the latest tax data available. We always update federal tax information on January 1. State tax rate information is harder to come by, but we update it as soon as possible. Historically, that has been six to twelve months into the year. Tax bracket ranges are typically adjusted for inflation, so we assume that inflation by itself will not cause major changes to your tax rate. Your income will likely be different in the future, and that will affect your tax rate. So we use income increases due to inflation and typical salary growth to estimate what your future tax rate might be. We allow tax deduction and dependent overrides, which can affect your personal rate. We plan ahead for inflation We don’t know how inflation will change, but we can reference known historical ranges, as well as targets set by fiscal policy. The most important thing is to factor in some inflation—especially for long-term goals like retirement—because we know it won’t be zero. We currently assume a 2% inflation rate in our retirement planning advice and in our safe withdrawal advice, which is what the Fed currently targets. Getting additional advice At Betterment, we automate what we can, and leave the rest to humans. Machines are ideal for rule-based decisions, calculations at scale, and data-aggregation. But people are usually better at complex decisions, abstract thoughts, and flexibility in logic and inputs. Human advisors are much better at behavioral coaching, building advice models, and dealing with complex financial situations. So we complement our automated advice with access to our financial planning experts through advice packages or our Premium plan, which offers unlimited calls and emails with our team of CFP® professionals. Whether you need a one-time consultation or ongoing support, you can always discuss your unique financial situations with one of our licensed financial professionals. Managing your money with Betterment Our mission is to empower you to make the most of your money, so you can live better. Sometimes the best way to do that is with human creativity and critical thought. Sometimes it’s with machine automation and precision. Usually, it takes a healthy dose of both.

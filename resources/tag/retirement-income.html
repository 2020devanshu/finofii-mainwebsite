      How To Use Your Health Savings Account (HSA) For Retirement  Once you turn 65, you can use them for anything you want—without incurring penalties. In 1 minute Like IRAs and 401(k)s, health savings accounts provide tax benefits. Your contributions to an HSA are tax-free, and if you use this money to cover qualified medical costs, your withdrawals are tax-free, too. With the right HSA, you can even invest these funds and earn interest on your contributions. Unfortunately, there’s a couple of catches. You can read more detail here, but the key highlights are below. For starters, you’re only eligible to contribute to an HSA if you’re currently enrolled in a high deductible health plan (HDHP) and meet a few other conditions: You are not enrolled in Medicare You are not someone else’s dependent You do not have other health coverage And just as importantly, if you use HSA funds on unqualified expenses before you turn 65, there’s a steep 20% penalty. Many people should expect to have more medical costs during retirement, and since withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax-free, it’s usually best to delay using your HSA until retirement. And since the penalty disappears after 65, HSAs can be a great tool to save for general retirement, too. Especially if you’re already maxing out your contributions to other retirement accounts! If you’re thinking about switching health plans to open an HSA, make sure you consider whether an HDHP is right for you and your family. Your HSA won’t help you plan for retirement if you have to use it all on medical expenses each year. That’s why it’s usually smart to have a fully-funded emergency fund before or soon after signing up for an HDHP. You’ll also want to choose an HSA with investment options that fit your goals. Decades away from retirement? An HSA that only lets you invest in short-term money market funds probably isn’t ideal. As long as the health plan is a good fit and you find the right opportunity, an HSA can be a smart investment in your future. In 5 minutes In this guide, we’ll cover: HSA eligibility The benefits of HSAs HSA withdrawal rules Using an HSA for retirement Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are designed to cover future medical expenses. But that’s not the only way to use them. Thanks to their tax benefits and withdrawal rules, HSAs can make a valuable addition to your retirement plan. As long as you’re eligible, you can make tax-deductible contributions to an HSA. The balance on this account rolls over every year, so there’s no pressure to “use it or lose it.” But you can’t just dump all your extra money into an HSA to avoid taxes, either. Your contribution limit depends on your age and who your health plan covers. If you’re 55 or over, you can make additional “catch-up” contributions. And if your family is covered by your health plan, it effectively doubles your limit. HSA Contribution Limits &nbsp; Contribution Limits Catch-up Contribution Limits (for individuals 55 and above) HSA 2021 2022 2021 2022 Self-only coverage $3,600 $3,650 $1,000 $1,000 Family coverage $7,200 $7,300 $1,000 $1,000 Want to take advantage of an HSA? First you need to find out if you’re eligible. Am I eligible for an HSA? To be eligible for an HSA, you have to: Be covered under a high deductible health plan (HDHP). Not be enrolled in Medicare. Not be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return. Have no other health coverage except what the IRS covers under “Other Employee Health Plans”. Your employer may have information on HSA providers available to you. The expanded IRS rules can provide more detailed eligibility information. What are the benefits of an HSA? Health Savings Accounts have a couple tax benefits that help you make the most of your assets. Your contributions are pre-tax, meaning you can deduct them from your income taxes. You can use these funds at any time to pay for qualified medical expenses without paying taxes or penalties. And when you turn 65, you can use your HSA for anything without incurring a penalty. While you must have a high deductible health plan in order to contribute to your HSA, your HSA isn’t tied to a specific employer. It stays with you when you change jobs or retire. The money doesn’t leave the account until you use it. Also, your employer may contribute to your HSA—and since the contribution is pre-tax, it doesn’t count toward your gross income. Some HSAs are specialized savings accounts. But some are actually investment accounts. Any interest and earnings that come from these HSAs are tax-free provided you don’t use them on unqualified expenses before you turn 65. So HSAs can rank amongst the best ways to save for retirement, on par with some 401(k)s and IRAs depending on factors such as an employer match, fees, and/or investment choices. HSA withdrawal rules Need some money to cover unexpected medical costs? Make a tax-free withdrawal. Don’t need it? Save it for your retirement. Withdrawing from an HSA for non-medical expenses comes with a 20% penalty . . . unless you’re over 65. Once you turn 65, withdrawals from an HSA work a lot like withdrawals from a traditional IRA or 401(k). Your withdrawals count toward your annual income, so you’ll pay income taxes based on your tax bracket. However, if you use your withdrawal to pay for medical expenses, it’s still tax-free. Basically, there are three possible outcomes when you withdraw from an HSA—and it all comes down to your age and what you use the money for. Your age Qualified Medical Expenses Other Expenses Less than 65 years old No taxes, no penalty Taxes are applicable, 20% penalty 65 years old or older Taxes are applicable, no penalty How to use your Health Savings Account for retirement When you reach retirement age, medical bills can start to add up quickly. Use your HSA to cover these expenses, and you’re triple-dipping on the tax benefits! Your contributions are tax free, your interest and earnings are tax free, and so are your withdrawals. From a financial planning perspective, that’s hard to beat. And it can make expenses like long-term care a lot less frightening. But an HSA is also a great supplement to your IRA or 401(k). Since the 20% penalty disappears when you turn 65, you won’t have to worry about whether an expense is qualified—just use your money as you see fit. Before you choose an HSA ... An HSA is like a financial Swiss Army Knife. But while it’s highly versatile, it’s not the right choice for everyone. So, before you switch health plans and open an HSA, there are a few things to consider. Know the fees When it comes to fees and other costs, HSAs are often less transparent than accounts like 401(k)s. Look at the full fee schedule for your HSA before contributing. Also, sometimes your employer will cover all, or a portion, of your fees—so find out about that, too. Explore the investment options Ideally, you want an HSA with investment options that fit your goals. Some providers only allow investments with low risk and low returns, like money market funds. Other HSAs offer multiple mutual fund listings with higher returns and more risk exposure. Some HSAs have minimums before you can start investing. For example, you might only be able to invest your money once you’ve contributed $1,000 to the HSA. Stay current on withdrawal rules Withdrawal rules around taxes and penalties can change with new regulations, so it’s important to stay up-to-date with any new changes that take place. Don’t just switch to an HDHP A high-deductible health plan isn’t right for everyone. Before switching to an HDHP so you can use an HSA to save for retirement, make sure that works for you and your family. A high-deductible health plan brings with it the potential for higher out-of-pocket medical costs.

      Save Taxes When Withdrawing in Retirement  A smart withdrawal strategy during retirement can help make your portfolio last longer, while also easing potential tax burdens. When you retire, you can no longer count on a paycheck to fund your lifestyle. Though you may have some sources of fixed income, such as from Social Security or defined benefit pension plans, the income from these sources may not be enough to cover all of your regular expenses. That can leave you relying on the money from your investment portfolio to maintain your expenses and lifestyle. As a smart investor, you probably already have an idea of how much money you can safely spend during each year of retirement. But still, one important question remains: In which order should you withdraw from your accounts? While the true answer to this question depends largely on your individual circumstances, your actions can have a huge impact on both your tax bill and the longevity of your portfolio. Taxes will likely be one of your largest expenses in retirement (on par with healthcare), so a smart withdrawal strategy is crucial to your retirement success. Luckily, you often have more control over your taxes in retirement than at any other point in your life. While there are common strategies to follow, there are other more advanced strategies that could lead to substantial tax savings. At Betterment, we’ve established some guidelines to not only help build a smart retirement income plan, but to also try to save on taxes by establishing an order in which you should withdraw from your various investment accounts in retirement. But first, let’s examine how your money is taxed when withdrawn in retirement. How Withdrawals Are Taxed Before creating your retirement income strategy, you must first understand how withdrawals from your various accounts are taxed. We’ll explain the typical tax consequences by taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts. Taxable Accounts (individual, joint, and trusts): Investment income, such as dividends or interest income, is generally taxed in the year it is received. Any withdrawals are subject to capital gains tax, but only on the growth of the investment—not the principle. Tax-Deferred Accounts (Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and Thrift Savings Plans): Unlike taxable accounts, no taxes are due on investment income or growth—until you make a withdrawal. When you do take money out, that full amount is subject to ordinary income tax. You are essentially delaying the payment of taxes. Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRAs or Roth 401(k) plans): All investment income, growth, and withdrawals are tax-free, if meeting the requirements for a qualified distribution. Taxes on Withdrawals Vary By Account Type As you can see, pulling money from each of these account types (taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free) can have very different tax consequences. &nbsp; A Withdrawal Strategy for Tax Efficiency The ideal order for withdrawing money from your various accounts during retirement is as follows: First, pull money from your taxable accounts. Once those accounts are depleted, begin withdrawing money from tax-deferred accounts. Lastly, take money out of tax-free accounts. The reason that this strategy is generally most tax-efficient is the power of tax deferral and the compound growth that it provides. The longer you can shelter your tax-deferred and tax-free accounts, the better. That means more money stays in your accounts and can grow over time. Let’s look at how this order of operations works in more detail. Example: Why You Should Withdraw From Taxable Accounts First If you decide to withdraw money from your Traditional 401(k), every dollar will be taxed as ordinary income, which is the highest tax rate to which you could be subjected. In this hypothetical example, let’s say you need $1,000 and you are in the 24% marginal tax bracket. To end up with a net of $1,000, you would actually have to withdraw $1,316, because of the additional tax liability: $1,316 (amount withdrawn) x 24% (marginal tax bracket) = $316 (taxes owed) However, if instead you first pull money out from your taxable individual account, two things happen. First, as long as the money has been invested for over one year, the tax rate on your sold assets is lower. Long-term capital gains taxes are generally 15%.1 Second, you don’t pay taxes on the full withdrawal, only on the growth. If you bought the investment for $600, you only have to withdraw $1,071 to end up with a net of $1,000: $1,071 (amount withdrawn) – $600 (your basis) = $471 (capital gain) x 15% = $71 (taxes owed) A $1,316 withdrawal versus a $1,071 withdrawal results in a difference of $245 that gets to stay invested and potentially grow for a longer period of time. The benefit of tax deferral is clear. With Roth accounts, it gets even better. Money inside a Roth will never be taxed again if you meet the qualified distribution rules, so you keep 100% of all growth or income you earn. This is why tax-free accounts should generally be the last accounts you touch. Incorporating Minimum Distributions Generally, once you reach age 72, you must begin taking Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from your tax-deferred (non-Roth IRA) accounts. Not doing so will result in a 50% penalty on the amount you were supposed to take. This changes things—but only slightly. At this point, you’d want to follow these new steps: First, withdraw your RMDs. If you still need more, then you can pull from taxable accounts. Once depleted, start withdrawing from your tax-deferred accounts. Lastly, pull money from tax-free accounts. Supercharge Your Withdrawal Strategy You’ve seen the power of tax deferral, but if you’re a Betterment customer, there are other ways in which we help make your retirement income plan even more effective. Specific Lot Selection: When you make a withdrawal, we automatically sell investments that are at a loss first, which helps minimize your current tax hit. Account Specific Asset Allocation: We put tax-efficient asset classes (such as municipal bonds) in your taxable accounts, rather than in your tax-sheltered accounts. Both of these strategies seek to further optimize your tax withdrawal strategies. We execute on these tactics for you so that you can keep more money inside your accounts where it is able to grow. The Problem of Roller Coaster Income Unfortunately, putting a plan into action is always more complicated than in theory. In retirement, you will likely have multiple sources of non-investment income coming from Social Security, defined benefit pensions, rental income, part-time work, and/or RMDs. However, these fixed income streams do not all begin or end at the same time, and some can vary from year to year, just as a roller coaster goes up and down. This can cause your tax bracket and your spending needs to fluctuate throughout retirement, adding a layer of complexity to your retirement income plan. At first glance, these fluctuations seem to make creating a retirement income plan more difficult. Does the recommended strategy stated above, then, still apply? In most cases, yes. And with a little extra planning, you may actually be able to use these swings to your advantage. Smooth Out Bumps in Your Tax Bracket For most years, Betterment recommends pulling from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and tax-free accounts last. However, you should look for abnormal years of high and low income fluctuations and their associated tax brackets, then plan accordingly. By temporarily altering the above strategy, you can “smooth” out your tax bracket throughout retirement and reduce taxes. Lower Income, Lower Tax Bracket Some years you may find yourself in a lower bracket than usual. During these years, it may make sense to fill these low brackets with withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts before touching your taxable accounts, and possibly consider Roth conversions. Common examples of low-bracket years may occur when: You retire before you plan on claiming Social Security benefits. You have large balances in your IRA/traditional 401(k) that will cause future RMDs to bump you into higher brackets. Higher Income, Higher Tax Bracket On the other hand, you may have years where you are in an abnormally high tax bracket. In this case, it may make sense to pull from tax-free accounts first to minimize the effect of higher tax rates. Remember, higher taxes mean larger withdrawals and less money staying invested. Common examples of high-bracket years occur when: You sell a home or rental property and end up with large capital gains. You are working part-time in retirement and have a good year financially. You lose a large deduction, for example, perhaps you pay off your mortgage.

We call this tax diversification, and it gives you the flexibility you need in retirement. Many customers have the majority of their savings in Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs, and little to no money in Roth accounts. That means you have no choice as to the order in which you withdraw from your investments, and you will pay taxes accordingly. Most retirees should seek to have some money in all three tax pools. The benefits of investment diversification are well known and often talked about, but tax diversification is not something that is often discussed. Generally, the only way to get money into each tax pool is by making direct contributions. However, a Roth conversion can be a powerful strategy to move money between tax pools. Building a tax-efficient retirement income plan is one of the main reasons tax diversification is so important. Extend The Life Of Your Portfolio Having a retirement income plan that incorporates taxes can extend the life of your portfolio. In general, we recommend you withdraw from your taxable accounts first, then your tax-deferred accounts, and lastly from your tax-free accounts. Implementing strategies such as Tax Loss Harvesting+, specific lot selection, and account specific asset allocation can further reduce or delay taxes. You should also smooth out any bumps in your tax bracket during retirement by accelerating tax-deferred withdrawals during low tax years and choosing tax-free withdrawals during high tax years. To do this, you must have money in all three “tax pools” (taxable, tax-deferred and tax-free). We call this tax diversification. Please note that Betterment is not a tax advisor. While we suggest everyone consult a tax professional to discuss their particular situation, those with more complicated situations such as complex estate planning or charitable giving may also want to consult an estate planning attorney. Even in such cases, we hope that these guidelines will still provide a solid foundation for your retirement income strategy. This article is intended to be educational in nature, and not meant to be relied upon as tax or investment advice. 1 As of the date published, long-term capital gains are generally taxed at 15%. However, if your taxable income is greater than $459,750 ($517,200 married filing jointly), you will pay 20% on long-term capital gains. An additional 3.8% Medicare Surtax also applies to those whose MAGI is above $200,000 single/$250,000 married filing jointly. Still, the tax rate on these long-term capital gains will be lower than your tax rate on ordinary income, so the reasoning still applies. Conversely, taxpayers with taxable income below $41,675 ($83,350 married filing jointly) pay 0% tax on long-term capital gains, making this strategy even more appealing.

      Why the 4% Rule Is Broken  There are fundamental flaws in the popular 4% rule for retirement income, including its reliance on a higher yield environment. &nbsp; In today's economy, you need a better, more dynamic approach to planning your retirement income. For the last 20 years, many retirees have relied on the so-called 4% rule when determining how much of their nest egg to spend each year. As the name implies, the rule is notable for its simplicity: as long as you withdraw no more than 4% of your initial portfolio, adjusted for inflation, you shouldn't run out of money. That rule is now being called into doubt—and for good reason. In today’s more volatile, lower-yield climate, this flat-rate withdrawal approach can put you at greater risk of outliving your money, or living on less than you could. Recent research has caused considerable debate, and sparked some much-needed innovation around that old guideline. A rigorous new study led by Betterment’s quantitative portfolio specialist Lisa Huang finds that applying the 4% rule under current market conditions is expected to prematurely deplete a retirement portfolio 30% of the time, assuming 3% inflation and a 30-year retirement.1 To arrive at this conclusion, we ran a Monte Carlo simulation to test thousands of trial futures, with the results presented in the chart below. Our research led to the creation of Betterment’s new&nbsp;retirement income&nbsp;product, released in April 2014. Our online retirement solution automates withdrawals, calculated based on a dynamic formula, fully integrated with an automated, low-cost, liquid portfolio.&nbsp;The algorithms are optimized to ensure that there is less than a 4% chance of running out of money—and a 90% chance that the annual withdrawal amount never drops below 2% of the initial portfolio balance (with the annual withdrawals expected to be above 4% on average, often significantly so.) The quest for stability Credit for the 4% rule belongs to Bill Bengen, a financial planner in California, whose&nbsp;research on the topic was first published in the&nbsp;Journal of Financial Planning&nbsp;in&nbsp;the early 1990's.&nbsp;Bengen came up with a formula for what seemed to be a safe withdrawal rate that would accomplish the top goals of retirees: Provide a fixed rate of withdrawal, like an annuity Rely on an easy-to-use withdrawal formula (unlike, say, required minimum distributions) Minimize retirees’ risk of running out of money However, while the 4% figure remained fixed in the public's imagination, the rates it relied on were anything but. Twenty years ago, the yield on a three-month Treasury bill was 6%. So while Bengen’s model called for a 50/50 stock allocation, even those with a more conservative asset allocation could still draw down 4% annually adjusted for inflation, and reasonably expect to preserve their capital. Even in 2002, the 5-year US Treasury yield was still 4.5%. That’s no longer the case—today a three-month Treasury is .04% and a 5-year is around 1.67%. In fact at least one paper has speculated that the apparent success of the 4% rule during the last 20 years may have been dependent on specific market conditions—which have become less and less favorable—and called its success an “anomaly.” It makes sense that the rule’s rise to popularity was a happy accident when you consider that the first decade after Bengen created his model was an exceptional time of low inflation and high corporate earnings in the U.S. A fly in the ointment But even without changes in the economic climate, the last couple of decades have highlighted several other, fundamental flaws in Bengen's approach: The 4% rule is based on the portfolio’s initial balance; subsequent market performance isn’t dynamically factored into the withdrawal rate—even though it can dramatically affect the portfolio’s balance. Flat-rate withdrawals that ignore dramatic market changes can lead to premature portfolio depletion. Likewise, a flat withdrawal rate doesn’t take into account personal changes in health or lifestyle that naturally occur with age. Many retirees need more flexibility in their cash flow to handle the inevitable ups and downs of life. &nbsp;In particular, an unfavorable market climate in the early years of retirement, coupled with a rigid withdrawal formula, increases the risk of asset depletion, because capital preservation during those early years is critical to the portfolio’s ongoing growth. Conversely, if returns are higher than expected in the early phase of retirement, but your withdrawals are static, you run the risk leaving money on the table at the end of your life that could have been used for greater enjoyment in previous years. The quest for a sustainable spending model Understandably, many retirees prefer fixed withdrawal rates because they’re predictable—that’s why annuities are popular. But several companies, including Betterment, find that retirees fare much better with a dynamic withdrawal strategy over the long-term (without the restrictions of annuities). Betterment’s Retirement Income service continually factors in a retirement portfolio's balance, projected inflation as well as retirees’ personal information, to come up with a dynamic asset allocation and spending plan that retirees can follow automatically—or further customize&nbsp;with a few clicks on their digital dashboard. Learn more about Betterment's new Retirement Income service. Generally, you can expect to withdraw more than 4% per year, depending on your age and risk profile. The initial portfolio starts with a 56% stock allocation and we use highly responsive algorithms within the product to factor in portfolio performance and create a glide path that’s designed to stave off longevity risk and preserve capital. By contrast, the two other companies that now offer retirees a similar, dynamic spending model only approach the issue from a financial planning standpoint, as opposed to advice that is actually implemented in an automated fashion. Last fall, Vanguard announced a new dynamic spending model for retirees which combines aspects of the 4% rule with the percentage-of-portfolio approach, in which you calculate a new withdrawal percentage each year, but don’t factor in inflation. This hybrid strategy sets a floor and a ceiling for withdrawals, based on the prior year. And in March 2014, J.P. Morgan Asset Management announced a dynamic retirement income withdrawal strategy. This proprietary model combines five key factors (including life expectancy, assets and forward-looking market projections) to create a customized portfolio and spending plan that retirees can adjust as needed with their advisers. However, neither of these two products are currently integrated with a live portfolio that automates the advice and the glide path—as well as the withdrawals—the way Betterment does. Out with the old, in with the new Dealing with a variable retirement income from year to year is a relatively new idea. Fortunately the Betterment model is designed to provide stability. The algorithms are optimized to balance the dual objectives of maximizing lifetime withdrawals, and keeping the withdrawal amount within a consistent range year after year. Best of all, by working with some natural ups and downs in your income from year to year, you’re actually improving your overall outcome. With the Betterment income strategy, there is less than 4% chance you will run out of money. 1We found the expected failure rate of the 4% rule under current conditions to be 31% when applied to a Betterment portfolio with a 30% stock allocation. Though analysis marshaled in support of the 4% heuristic in the 1990's tended to recommend a 50% stock allocation (e.g. the&nbsp;seminal Trinity study&nbsp;from 1998), these studies generally assumed a simple two-asset allocation between an S&amp;P 500 fund and high grade bonds - sometimes referred to as the "naive" portfolio. The Betterment portfolio, with global diversification in both the stock and bond basket, has both higher volatility and higher expected returns&nbsp;at the same allocation to stocks. &nbsp;A 50% stock naive portfolio has the expected volatility of a 33% stock Betterment portfolio and the expected returns of a 26% stock Betterment portfolio. Accordingly, to test the assumptions of the 4% rule as applied to a two-asset portfolio at 50% stocks, we are highlighting the Monte Carlo results using a 30% stock Betterment portfolio. Notably, we found that applying the 4% rule even to a 50% stock Betterment portfolio is expected to fail 21% of the time under modern market conditions.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      How To Manage Your Income In Retirement  An income strategy during retirement can help make your portfolio last longer, while also easing potential tax burdens. In 10 seconds How you manage your retirement income can have a significant impact on how long your savings last. Adjust your asset allocation over time and withdraw from your accounts in the right order to help stretch your money further. In 1 minute Retirement planning doesn’t end when you retire. To have the retirement you’ve been dreaming of, you need to ensure your savings will last. And how much you withdraw each month isn’t all that matters. If you’re not careful, market downswings can dramatically lower the value of your portfolio—and once you start making withdrawals, it’s much harder to rebound with the market. It’s important to prepare for the risk. As retirement draws nearer, you should consider adjusting your asset allocation to take on less risk. During retirement, you may gradually shift to an allocation of just 30% stocks, with the remainder going toward less volatile assets, like bonds. As you make withdrawals and earn dividends, you’ll likely want to rebalance your portfolio, either manually or through automated services like those at Betterment, based on the market and your target allocation. Even though you're retired, a financial safety net is still essential. You should strongly consider maintaining enough funds for three to six months of expenses in a low-risk, accessible account, so if things take a turn for the worse, you have something to fall back on. Supplemental income helps, too. Social Security, rental income, a part-time job, or pension withdrawals can help you maintain your lifestyle in retirement and leave more of your nest egg in growth mode. It’s also a good idea to withdraw from your accounts in the right order. Generally you should consider starting with taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and save the tax-free accounts for last. One exception is when you have Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs). In that case, you can withdraw your RMDs first, then take anything else you need from your taxable accounts, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts. Another exception is when your tax bracket is higher/lower than usual. Sound complicated? Betterment can help you decide exactly how much to withdraw based on your timeline and portfolio. In 5 minutes In this guide we’ll cover: Why changes in the market affect you differently in retirement How to keep bad timing from ruining your retirement How to decide which accounts to withdraw from first Part of retirement planning involves thinking about your retirement budget. But whether you’re already retired or you’re simply thinking ahead, it’s also important to think about how you’ll manage your income in retirement. Retirement is a huge milestone. And reaching it changes how you have to think about taxes, your investments, and your income. For starters, changes in the market can seriously affect how long your money lasts. Why changes in the market affect you differently in retirement Stock markets can swing up or down at any time. They’re volatile. When you’re saving for a distant retirement, you usually don’t have to worry as much about temporary dips. But during retirement, market volatility can have a dramatic effect on your savings. An investment account is a collection of individual assets. When you make a withdrawal from your retirement account, you’re selling off assets to equal the amount you want to withdraw. So say the market is going through a temporary dip. Since you’re retired, you have to continue making withdrawals in order to maintain your income. During the dip, your investment assets may have less value, so you have to sell more of them to equal the same amount of money. When the market goes back up, you have fewer assets that benefit from the rebound. The opposite is true, too. When the market is up, you don’t have to sell as many of your assets to maintain your income. There will always be good years and bad years in the market. How your withdrawals line up with the market’s volatility is called the “sequence of returns.” Unfortunately, you can’t control it. In many ways, it’s the luck of the withdrawal. Still, there are ways to decrease the potential impact of a bad sequence of returns. How to keep bad timing from ruining your retirement The last thing you want is to retire and then lose your savings to market volatility. So you’ll want to take some steps to try and protect your retirement from a bad sequence of returns. Adjust your level of risk As you near or enter retirement, it’s likely time to start cranking down your stock-to-bond allocation. Invest too heavily in stocks, and your retirement savings could tank right when you need them. Betterment generally recommends turning down your ratio to about 56% stocks in early retirement, then gradually decreasing to about 30% toward the end of retirement. Rebalance your portfolio During retirement, the two most common cash flows in/out of your investment accounts will likely be dividends you earn and withdrawals you make. If you’re strategic, you can use these cash flows as opportunities to rebalance your portfolio. For example, if stocks are down at the moment, you likely want to withdraw from your bonds instead. This can help prevent you from selling stocks at a loss. Alternatively, if stocks are rallying, you may want to reinvest your dividends into bonds (instead of cashing them out) in order to bring your portfolio back into balance with your preferred ratio of stocks to bonds. Keep a safety net Even in retirement, it’s important to have an emergency fund. If you keep a separate, low-risk account in your portfolio with enough money to cover three to six months of expenses, you can likely cushion—or ride out altogether—the blow of a bad sequence of returns. Supplement your income Hopefully, you’ll have enough retirement savings to produce a steady income from withdrawals. But it’s nice to have other income sources, too, to minimize your reliance on investment withdrawals in the first place. Social Security might be enough—although a pandemic or other disaster can deplete these funds faster than expected. Maybe you have a pension you can withdraw from, too. Or a part-time job. Or rental properties. Along with the other precautions above, these additional income sources can help counter bad returns early in retirement. While you can’t control your sequence of returns, you can control the order you withdraw from your accounts. And that’s important, too. How to decide which accounts to withdraw from first In retirement, taxes are usually one of your biggest expenses. They’re right up there with healthcare costs. When it comes to your retirement savings, there are three “tax pools” your accounts can fall under: Taxable accounts: individual accounts, joint accounts, and trusts Tax-deferred accounts: individual retirement accounts (IRAs), 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and Thrift Savings Plans Tax-free accounts: Roth IRAs, Roth 401(k)s Each of these account types (taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free) are taxed differently—and that’s important to understand when you start making withdrawals. Here’s how taxes work with each of these account types. When you have funds in all three tax pools, this is known as “tax diversification.” This strategy can create some unique opportunities for managing your retirement income. Withdrawing from your taxable accounts first usually gives your portfolio more time to grow. This is because you only pay taxes on the capital gains, so more money stays in your account. With a tax-deferred account like a 401(k), you pay taxes on the full amount you withdraw, so with each withdrawal, taxes take more away from your portfolio’s future earning potential. Since you don’t have to pay taxes on withdrawals from your tax-free accounts, it’s typically best to save these for last. You want as much tax-free money as possible, right? So the ideal withdrawal order is generally: Taxable accounts Tax-deferred accounts Tax-free accounts But in abnormal years, where you find your tax bracket either higher or lower than usual, you likely will want to deviate from this strategy, and attempt to “smooth” out your tax bracket. This is more advanced, but can help you take advantage of lower tax years and minimize the impact of higher tax years. There’s just one other thing to consider: Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs). When you reach a certain age, you’re required to take a certain amount from your tax-deferred accounts each month—or else you’ll lose 50% of the required amount. If that applies to you, you’ll want to take out your RMD first, then follow the order above. So it goes: Required Minimum Distributions, taxable accounts, tax-deferred accounts, tax-free accounts. Withdraw your retirement income from your accounts in that order, and you’ll likely help your savings last as long as possible. Take the guesswork out of your retirement income Sometimes it’s hard to decide how much to withdraw from your retirement savings. And as you enjoy years of retirement, when and how should you adjust your asset allocation? Betterment helps you with both of these decisions. As a Betterment investor, when you designate yourself a retiree, you can set up a goal called “Retirement Income.” Our algorithm will automatically calculate a safe withdrawal amount and recommend an asset allocation based on where you’re at and what you have to work with. You can set up automatic withdrawals from your Betterment account to your checking account, helping you maintain a personalized payment schedule. Ready to get started?

    <p class="item-title">Retirement Income Shouldn’t Be a Guessing Game</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Retirement Income Shouldn’t Be a Guessing Game  Betterment’s Retirement Income goal takes the guess work out of your most important retirement question: Will I run out of money? When it comes to creating a cash flow strategy for retirement you need the answer to one important question: “Will I have enough money to last a lifetime?” In today’s low-yield environment—and given most people’s longer lifespans—your retirement savings need to keep working for you long after your earning years are over. And you need to know how much of it you can withdraw safely to stay the course over the coming decades. That may sound like a complicated formula—but Betterment has been working hard on this problem to make it easy for you to get the answers. We launched an&nbsp;online retirement income solution that features an automated, dynamic withdrawal strategy, built on top of a low-cost, fully liquid portfolio with dynamic asset allocation. A Dynamic Approach to Retirement Income Betterment’s investing team has developed an income solution to provide dynamic retirement planning. Unlike traditional services, our income advice and allocation adjusts over time with your age, portfolio value, risk, and your withdrawal rate. Your money is invested in our globally diversified portfolio of 12 asset classes. Based on sophisticated algorithms, our Retirement Income&nbsp;service factors in your personal information to offer the optimal&nbsp;risk allocation across our globally diversified portfolio of ETFs and advises on the optimal&nbsp;amount for safe withdrawal for the coming year, while balancing the dual concerns of maximizing total income, and year-to-year income consistency. Both allocation and income advice are offered through Betterment’s existing portfolio and platform—so no matter your level of investing expertise, it’s time-efficient and easy to manage. The result is that income is variable, changing from year to year depending on portfolio balance and other factors. Over time, this flexibility can extend your capital if necessary, preventing the portfolio from being depleted prior to the end of your selected time horizon. To be sure, this kind of variability might not work for every retiree, but as part of a total&nbsp;of a total return strategy, this income goal is designed to extend money for as long as you it need to last. Expert Design The design for Betterment’s Retirement Income was led by product manager Alex Benke, CFP®, who is a second-generation financial planner and spent 10 years at J.P. Morgan before joining Betterment, and Lisa Huang, who holds a Ph.D in Physics from Harvard University and worked as a quantitative strategist at Goldman Sachs. Benke and Huang evaluated various withdrawal methods at a wide range of allocations using a Monte Carlo simulation for testing thousands of trial-run market scenarios. As part of their analysis, they tested the viability of the popular but flawed 4% rule—finding that a dynamic withdrawal and allocation strategy is clearly a better solution to maximize total income while making it likely&nbsp;that the money will last for the specified period. Why Betterment’s Solution Is Better Many of the existing retirement services and strategies rely on static withdrawals—outmoded for today’s low-yield environment, global economy and people’s longer lives.&nbsp;The shortcomings of other services can mean that you may miss out on much needed growth, or, as with annuities, you get some predictability at the cost of liquidity, which can be constraining. Consider the failings of the 4% rule—a popular retirement strategy developed in the 1990s and designed to provide a steady stream of income—which, under current conditions is expected to lead to portfolio depletion about 30% of the time, analysis by Benke and Huang showed. Read more here on why the 4% rule is broken.&nbsp; Betterment’s innovation is to make income advice fully dynamic—regularly adjusting in response to multiple variables—and to fully automate that advice, integrated with our efficient, low-cost global portfolio.&nbsp;Just as the income advice, so goes the underlying asset allocation, fully dynamic, adjusted along a glide path over time to reflect a shifting risk tolerance. Our advice for a safe annual withdrawal rate would generally range from 2% to 10%, based over time on a host of factors, including your portfolio's balance. We advocate a yearly adjustment to your auto-withdrawal setting (i.e. income) to stay on track with advice. Our model was designed to maximize total withdrawals while minimizing withdrawal variation. What Do We Mean by 'Safe'? With the 4% rule, and other strategies,&nbsp;a less than 10% chance of ruin (i.e. your balance is zero) was historically considered safe. But our research showed that with current market conditions, the 4% rule actually leads&nbsp;to ruin about 30% of the time. Not so safe after all. Betterment's Retirement Income is designed so that you have less than 4% chance of running out of money. Furthermore, the chance of your withdrawal amount falling below a 2% threshold of your initial balance is only about 10%. Using our advice means your chance of running out of money is 4% or less. In other words—you are more than 96% likely to have income throughout your chosen time horizon by following our advice. Unlike products like annuities, any remaining investments are fully&nbsp;liquid—meaning your heirs will have access to the money, even if income is no longer necessary. Understanding Variable Income: An Example Margaret is a 65-year-old college professor, and she is likely to live to 85 based on her family history and health. Using Betterment’s income service, her $500,000 Roth IRA is allocated for a 20-year time horizon at 56% stocks and her expected monthly withdrawal this year is $1,941—an annual rate of 4.65%. This is not her only income—she also has income from Social Security, a pension, and 401K. If the markets go up: In the first year, her Betterment portfolio grows by 7% and her new balance is $510,000 even after a year of making withdrawals. She’s a year older, however, and now her new recommended allocation is slightly less risky. Margaret’s monthly withdrawal rate will now be about $2,062 (about 4.85% of the new portfolio balance, but about 4.95% of the original value). If the markets go down: If instead the markets were down 7%, her new balance would be $443,338 after the withdrawals. The new withdrawal rate will be $1,791 per month, or $150 lower than the original starting withdrawal amount, and 4.30% of the original value. Although the withdrawal amounts do change depending on Margaret's portfolio performance, her average withdrawal over 20 years is expected to be around $2,503 assuming an average market return of 6%. It's exactly this dynamic withdrawal strategy that makes it likely her capital will last for the full 20 years. To be sure, every retiree can customize his or her time horizon. How to Get Started To get started, any Betterment customer who has designated herself as a retiree can access a goal type called Retirement Income. With this goal, Betterment’s algorithm then calculates a safe withdrawal amount and advises an allocation. Lastly, retirees can set up an automatic withdrawal from their Betterment income goal to their checking account to maintain fluid cash flow on a personalized payment schedule. The Results Monthly income may be a formula after all—but the peace of mind knowing that your money is more than 96% likely to last for however long you specify goes far beyond a spreadsheet.&nbsp;Like all our services, our income solution receives all the benefits of Betterment—security, automated investment management, global portfolio diversification, and tax efficiency.&nbsp;We believe we’ve developed an innovation that works for you, combining personalization and control with security and trust.

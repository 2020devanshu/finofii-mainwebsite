      Betterment’s Retirement Advice Tools Explained  Betterment aligns our investment advice with what it’s really like to pursue your financial goals. Learn about our retirement planning advice and how it can help you. TABLE OF CONTENTS Define What Retirement Means To You Setting Up Your Retirement Projections At Betterment Understanding Betterment’s Recommendations Taking Action Saving for retirement is one of the most popular reasons people use Betterment. This makes sense, since almost everybody dreams of retiring some day (or at least having the option to quit working or switch careers, if they choose). That’s why Betterment offers retirement tools in your account that allow you to define what retirement means to you, and then run projections that give guidance on whether your goal is on-track or off-track. Our advanced projections include key inputs like Social Security, inflation, life expectancy, and even investment accounts not held at Betterment. Once you have your retirement projections setup in your retirement goal, Betterment will give you personalized advice on how much you should be saving towards retirement, which accounts are most optimal for you, and how you should be invested. You can even run different “what-if” scenarios to see how things like retiring earlier, or saving more, affect your projections. Of course, we make it easy for you to then take action and make your money work for you. For example, you can open various types of retirement accounts. You can also enable our many automated tools to help you save more, manage your investments, and manage taxes. We even work to make rolling over other retirement accounts as easy as possible. Let’s walk through each of these areas in more detail, so you can learn how to make the most of Betterment’s retirement planning tools. Define what retirement means to you. Each person’s retirement plan is unique. That’s why we allow you to tell us how and when you’d like to retire, and then we shape our advice around those inputs. Afterall, our advice will be very different if you plan on retiring at age 55 vs. age 75. This is what we call goal-based investing, where you tell us your various financial goals, and we give you advice on how to achieve them. For many individuals, the initial step of defining retirement can be difficult. This is understandable. We often hear questions like “how do I know how much money I’ll spend in retirement?” or “can I retire tomorrow?” Don’t worry. Betterment built tools to help you answer these tough questions. Once you open a retirement goal in your Betterment account, our retirement planning tool will walk you through how to estimate both your retirement spending and retirement age in order to set up your plan. Estimating Retirement Spending How much you would like to spend during your retirement is the most important driver of your retirement plan, but it is often the hardest part to predict. Maybe your kids will be independent by then, but health care may cost more. Maybe your house will be paid off, but you’ll also want to travel more. These are just a few examples of how some spending categories may decrease, while others may increase. If you’re one of the few who happen to have a good idea of what you’d like to spend during retirement, we allow you to simply input that number. For those who are unsure, we have a helpful calculator that will automatically estimate a spending number for you. This number can serve as a starting point, but you can always override it. We then estimate your retirement spending by running key data points through a spending estimate formula. This formula includes expected wage increases (which tend to be higher than general inflation), cost of living data for your particular zip code, and an estimated percentage of income used to support your lifestyle (i.e. spent on goods and services) based on data from individuals with similar income to you. While not an exhaustive list, these data points provide a useful spending overview that are factored into our advice. Estimating Retirement Age When you’ll retire is also difficult to predict. The choice isn’t always yours to make either, as can be the case with unexpected health issues or being forced out of work. As with your retirement spending, if you have a particular retirement age in mind, you can simply enter it into our system. For those who are unsure, we default you to age 68, which is just beyond Full Retirement Age (FRA), as defined by the Social Security Administration, for many of our customers. Making Changes And Updates We know that life happens, and things change. The retirement plan you set up in your 30’s or 40’s may become outdated. That’s why we build flexibility into our retirement projections, and allow you to make changes to your plan. You can easily update your desired retirement spending or desired retirement age at any time. When you do, we will automatically update our projections based on your new inputs. This way, you can ensure your retirement plan is always up-to-date. In fact, we encourage you to review your retirement projections periodically for this exact reason. As a general guideline, you should review your retirement projections once per year, or after any major life event like a promotion, change in marital status, birth of a child, or other similar event. Setting Up Your Retirement Projections At Betterment Now that you’ve defined what retirement means to you, it’s time to run some projections and determine if you seem on-track or off-track to meet your retirement goal. Betterment will calculate this for you, but first we need to gather some information about your situation. The more information you tell us, the more accurate our corresponding projections can be. Existing Savings: Tell us which accounts you already have for retirement, so we can give you credit for the savings you already have. This should not include accounts that are set aside for other purposes, like emergency funds, buying a house, or your kid’s college. But it should include retirement accounts, even if they are not held at Betterment. Common examples of this are 401(k)s and your spouse’s retirement accounts as well. We recommend syncing these accounts to your Betterment account. Planned Future Savings: We can also factor in future retirement savings that you expect to make. Under each account, you can tell us how much you plan to contribute per year. You can even include employer matches, if applicable, to your workplace retirement accounts. Social Security Benefits: Social Security plays a key role in retirement for millions of Americans. We use your current income to estimate Social Security benefits according to the U.S. Social Security Administration’s benefit rules. We also adjust expected Social Security benefits based on projections from the Trustees Report. However, this is just an estimate, and you may prefer to instead login to your online Social Security account to view your official estimate and use that instead. Other Retirement Income: Some individuals may have other sources of retirement income, such as a pension or rental income. If this applies, you can enter that information into your projection inputs as well. Life Expectancy: We default your life expectancy to age 90, which is a conservative estimate compared to average life expectancies. Women tend to live longer than men, so keep this in mind as you adjust your retirement plan. You can always override our default age, if you’d like. With all of these inputs, your retirement plan should be personalized to your situation. We then use our Goal Projection and Advice methodology to estimate if you appear to be on-track to reach your retirement goal or not. If you’re off-track, that’s okay. We’ll give you recommendations to get on-track, and make it easy to take action on those recommendations. We don’t expect change to happen overnight, and even knowing where you stand is a great first step. Understanding Betterment’s Recommendations With your retirement projections in place, Betterment can now give you personalized recommendations to help you get on-track, or even if you are already on-track, to help maximize your savings and investments. The recommendations we give should answer many common questions we hear from customers, such as: How much should I be saving? Which accounts should I contribute to? How should I be invested? How much should I be saving? One of the most important recommendations we can give is telling you how much we estimate you should be saving per year to be on-track for retirement. Betterment will give you this top line number so that you have a target in mind to strive towards. Which accounts should I contribute to? For many people, you will need to combine multiple accounts to reach your goals and optimize your savings. Once you know how much you should be saving, we will also tell you which mix of accounts you should be putting those savings into, and show that to you in a prioritized list. This list includes things like tax bracket, employer match info, account fees, contribution limits, and more. This helps make sure your money is working as hard as possible for you. In particular, the use of tax-advantaged retirement accounts are an important benefit to consider when saving for retirement. Contributions to Traditional 401(k), Traditional 403(b), and Traditional IRA accounts are typically tax-deductible, which means you contribute on a pre-tax basis and normally don’t pay taxes until you make withdrawals. Contributions to Roth 401(k), Roth 403(b), and Roth IRA accounts are not tax-deductible, which means you contribute on an after-tax basis but they grow tax-free. How you contribute to your retirement accounts now can make a big difference over time. The earlier you invest, the more possibility there is for your investments to appreciate. This is especially true for retirement savings, because when you use tax-advantaged retirement accounts, such as IRAs or 401(k)s, all that time spent in the market can lead to benefits in tax-free growth. How should I be invested? Another critical component of your retirement plan is making sure you are invested appropriately. Betterment’s tools will give you feedback on key areas of your investments, even on your non-Betterment accounts. Our tools will give you feedback on how risky your investments are and if that risk level is appropriate given your time horizon to retirement. As a default for our recommended actions, if you have 20 or more years until you retire, we recommend 90% stocks. Then, our investment advice reduces your risk over time until your retirement date, when it hits 56% stocks. Finally, it glides down to 30% stocks during retirement. Our tools will also analyze your external accounts to determine if you seem to be paying more fees than you have to, and if you have too much cash sitting in your retirement accounts. Taking Action Even the best retirement plan won’t do you much good if you don’t take action. With Betterment’s smooth interface and powerful automation, taking action has rarely been easier. Open multiple retirement accounts: Many people can benefit from having multiple retirement accounts, like Roth and Traditional accounts. This can help you optimize for taxes and save beyond the contribution limits that some accounts have. Enable tax management algorithms: Optimizing for taxes can help your money work harder for you. Betterment is known for our advanced tax strategies like tax loss harvesting and tax coordination, which can both be put on autopilot in your Betterment accounts at the flip of a switch. Select a portfolio strategy: Betterment offers multiple portfolio strategies, which allow you to customize your investments and choose the strategy that best fits your needs and preferences. Enable investment management algorithms: Betterment allows you to automate many areas of investment management like rebalancing and auto-adjusting your investments over time. Roll over retirement accounts: Consolidating your investment accounts into Betterment may help you ensure your retirement portfolio is working together in a seamless, automated manner. Enable automatic deposits: Making retirement savings automatic can help you save more, and make maxing out your retirement accounts easier. Add beneficiaries: Adding beneficiaries can help ensure your money goes where you want it to, even after you pass away. All of these actions are important in setting up a comprehensive retirement plan that incorporates savings, investments, taxes, and more. Generally speaking, the earlier you start, the better off you’ll be. Start taking the above actions to set up your retirement plan at Betterment today.

      How To Make A Mega Backdoor Roth 401(k) Contribution  Looking to boost your retirement savings? Contributing above the limit through after-tax contributions into a traditional 401(k) can help you maximize your savings with potentially great tax benefits. For most people that participate in a 401(k) plan through their employer, $19,500 is the maximum contribution (pre-tax and Roth) you can make to your 401(k) in 2021 (those age 50 and older get an additional $6,500 catch-up contribution). This “standard” contribution is considered to be an employee elective deferral. But what if your 401(k) plan could allow you to contribute more than this amount? And how much more? Potentially up to $38,500 more in 2021. After-tax traditional 401(k) contributions are less commonly offered by employers, but for heavy savers or high-income earners who do have this option, after-tax traditional contributions are a great way to try and maximize your overall retirement contributions. “Super-size Me”: 401(k) 2020 Contribution Limits 401(k) plans are a type of defined contribution plan where you, as the employee, make your own contributions to your retirement. In 2021, the total annual contribution limit to defined contribution plans is $58,000 (or $64,500, if age 50 and older). This $58,000 limit consists of your $19,500 contribution (combination of pre-tax and Roth), as well as any matching contributions your employer makes, employer profit-sharing, and after-tax traditional 401(k) contributions made. Any employer match would potentially reduce the amount of after-tax contributions you could make into a traditional 401(k). But if your employer does not provide any matching contributions nor profit-sharing, you could contribute up to an extra $38,500 on an after-tax basis to your 401(k). Tax alert – Even if your employer offers after-tax traditional 401(k) contributions, you may not be able to fully maximize the contribution due to plan limits and nondiscrimination testing for highly compensated employees. How Do After-Tax Contributions Work? Now that we’ve covered different types of contributions that could be made to your 401(k), how do they all work? The $19,500 salary contribution can generally be made as either pre-tax (traditional), or post-tax (Roth): When you make pre-tax contributions, the amount contributed to your retirement plan reduces your taxable income for that year, so that you get a tax break in the year contributing. When you withdraw in the future, you will pay ordinary income taxes on the full amount of the withdrawal, basis and earnings included. With post-tax Roth contributions, the amount contributed does not reduce your taxable income for that year, as you pay tax on the money before it is contributed. As long as you meet general requirements, withdrawals will be free of tax, earnings included. After-tax contributions into a traditional 401(k) are not tax deductible and grow tax-deferred, meaning that earnings will be taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal. This is unlike general Roth 401(k) contributions, where earnings and withdrawals are tax-free. You might be wondering what happens to after-tax traditional 401(k) contributions after you retire or leave your company. IRS Notice 2014-54 states that earnings from these contributions while they are in the 401(k) would be rolled into a traditional IRA, where you will pay tax upon withdrawal. However, the original after-tax traditional contributions in your 401(k) are able to be rolled into a Roth IRA without paying taxes (since you already paid tax on the dollars contributed), where future growth and withdrawals are tax-free. Benefit To After-Tax Contributions For those who have the option and are able to make these contributions, it enables extra savings to be made into an account that grows tax-deferred rather than being saved to a taxable account, where you will owe annual taxes on dividends. After-tax traditional contributions allow you to indirectly contribute money to Roth-style accounts when you may not have been able to otherwise. For example, your income may be too high to make direct Roth IRA contributions or you may choose not to make Roth 401(k) contributions with your elective deferral because you’d prefer to make pre-tax contributions to reduce your taxable income. If that’s the case, the only other way you’d be able to get money into a Roth IRA for tax-free growth is to execute a Roth conversion, which may require you to pay income tax upon converting. The In-Plan Roth rollover Here is a strategy for how you can further amplify the benefits of after-tax traditional 401(k) contributions. If your employer allows you to make In-Plan Roth rollovers (not all plans offer the feature) – where you can effectively convert your traditional 401(k) to a Roth 401(k) – you can start the tax-free growth on your after-tax contributions even earlier. Any earnings on the after-tax traditional contributions would be considered taxable at the time of the In-Plan Roth rollover. The sooner this process is completed after the contribution is made, it would minimize taxable earnings. In other words, you don’t have to wait until you retire to get your after-tax contributions into a Roth 401(k). Steps To Take For Your Retirement Planning To see if your 401(k) plan offers after-tax traditional contributions, we recommend contacting your plan administrator. Note that Betterment for Business 401(k) plans currently do not offer the ability for you to make after-tax contributions to your Traditional 401(k), nor the ability to convert Traditional funds to Roth funds while the plan is active. Depending on each individual plan, these options could increase non-discrimination testing complexity and lead to unexpected refunds. Over time, we’ll continue to evaluate the value of these additional capabilities to our customers who hold Betterment 401(k) plans through their employer. For those that do have this option, you will want to consider all of the retirement accounts you have at your disposal, the tax benefits each offer, and your overall savings plan and cash-flow needs. If interested, you can speak with a financial planner to help you make the best decision for your retirement plan.

      How To Plan For Retirement  It depends on the lifestyle you want, the investment accounts available, and the income you expect to receive. In 1 minute Retirement planning is personal. It all depends on what you want and what you can do. No matter how far away retirement is, it’s worth thinking through what you want and how you’ll get there. Your retirement account needs to cover your cost of living—whatever that entails. Three of the biggest factors are: How much you want to spend each year Where you want to live When you want to retire Understanding these factors will help you decide how much you need to save. You will also need to decide where to put your money. For many people, retirement savings will live in some combination of these five accounts: Traditional 401(k) Roth 401(k) Traditional IRA Roth IRA Health Savings Account (HSA) 401(k)s are only available through an employer. IRAs are available to anyone. With 401(k)s and IRAs, a Traditional account usually gives you pre-tax benefits, and a Roth account gives you after-tax benefits. The right choice for you depends on whether you think you’ll be in a higher tax bracket now or when you retire. If you’re self-employed, there are some additional retirement accounts to consider, namely: Solo 401(k) SEP IRA SIMPLE IRA These are each suited toward companies of a particular size. A Solo 401(k) has high contribution limits, making it appealing, but it’s only available if you’re the only employee. For businesses with fewer than 100 employees, a SIMPLE IRA may be best, as it allows employees and employers to contribute. You’ll also want to think about supplemental income. If you can expect income beyond what you withdraw from a retirement account, such as social security benefits or a pension, you may not need to save as much. In 5 minutes In this guide, we’ll cover: How much you should save for retirement Choosing retirement accounts Supplemental income to consider Self-employed retirement options Most people want to retire some day. But retirement planning looks a little different for everyone. There’s more than one way to get there. And some people want to live more extravagantly—or frugally—than others. Your retirement plan should be based on the life you want to live and the financial options you have available. And the sooner you sort out the details, the better. Even if retirement seems far away, working out the details now will set you up to retire when and how you want to. First things first: figure out how much you need to save. How much should you save for retirement? How much you need to save ultimately depends on what you want retirement to look like. Some people see themselves traveling the world when they retire. Or living closer to their families. Maybe there’s a hobby you’ve wished you could spend more time and money on. Perhaps for you, retirement looks like the life you have now—just without the job. For many people, that’s a good place to start. Take the amount you spend right now and ask yourself: do you want to spend more or less than that each year of retirement? How long do you want your money to last? Answering these questions will give you a target amount you’ll need to reach and help you think about managing your income in retirement. Don’t forget to think about where you’ll want to live, too. Cost of living varies widely, and it has a big effect on how long your money will last. Move somewhere with a lower cost of living, and you need less to retire. Want to live it up in New York City, Seattle, or San Francisco? Plan to save significantly more. And finally: when do you want to retire? This will give you a target date to save it by (in investing, that’s called a time horizon). It’ll also inform how much you need to retire. Retiring early reduces your time horizon, and increases the number of expected years you need to save for. Still not sure how much to save? Betterment can help you plan for retirement. Choosing retirement accounts Once you know how much you need to save, it’s time to think about where that money will go. Earning interest and taking advantage of tax benefits can help you reach your goal faster, and that’s why choosing the right investment accounts is a key part of retirement planning. While there are many kinds of investment accounts, people usually use five main types to save for retirement. 1. Traditional 401(k) A Traditional 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan. These have two valuable advantages: Your employer may match a percentage of your contributions Your contributions are tax deductible You can only invest in a 401(k) if your employer offers one. If they do, and they match a percentage of your contributions, this is almost always an account you’ll want to take advantage of. The contribution match is free money. You don’t want to leave that on the table. And since your contributions are tax deductible, you’ll pay less income tax while you’re saving for retirement. 2. Roth 401(k) A Roth 401(k) works just like a Traditional one, but with one key difference: the tax advantages come later. You make contributions, your employer (sometimes) matches a percentage of them, and you pay taxes like normal. But when you withdraw your funds during retirement, you don’t pay taxes. This means any interest you earned on your account is tax-free. With both Roth and Traditional 401(k)s, you can contribute a maximum of $20,500 in 2022, or $27,000 if you’re age 50 or over. 3. Traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA) As with a 401(k), an IRA gives you tax advantages. Depending on your income, contributions may lower your pre-tax income, so you pay less income tax leading up to retirement. The biggest difference? Your employer doesn’t match your contributions. The annual contribution limits are also significantly lower: just $6,000 for 2022, or $7,000 if you’re age 50 or over. 4. Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA) A Roth IRA works similarly, but as with a Roth 401(k), the tax benefits come when you retire. Your contributions still count toward your taxable income right now, but when you withdraw in retirement, all your interest is tax-free. So, should you use a Roth or Traditional account? One option is to use both Traditional and Roth accounts for tax diversification during retirement. Another strategy is to compare your current tax bracket to your expected tax bracket during retirement, and try to optimize around that. Also keep in mind that your income may fluctuate throughout your career. So you may choose to do Roth now, but after a significant promotion you might switch to Traditional. 5. Health Savings Account (HSA) An HSA is another solid choice. Contributions to an HSA are tax deductible, and if you use the funds on medical expenses, your distributions are tax-free. After age 65, you can withdraw your funds just like a traditional 401(k) or IRA, even for non-medical expenses. You can only contribute to a Health Savings Accounts if you’re enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). In 2022, you can contribute up to $3,650 to an HSA if your HDHP covers only you, and up to $7,200if your HDHP covers your family. What other income can you expect? Put enough into a retirement account, and your distributions will likely cover your expenses during retirement. But if you can count on other sources of income, you may not need to save as much. For many people, a common source of income during retirement is social security. As long as you or your spouse have made enough social security contributions throughout your career, you should receive social security benefits. Retire a little early, and you’ll still get some benefits (but it may be less). This can amount to thousands of dollars per month. You can estimate the benefits you’ll receive using the Social Security Administration’s Retirement Estimator. Retirement accounts for the self-employed Self-employed people have a few additional options to consider. One Participant 401(k) Plan or Solo 401(k) A Solo 401(k) is similar to a regular 401(k). However, with a Solo 401(k), you’re both the employer and the employee. You can combine the employee contribution limit and the employer contribution limit. As long as you don’t have any employees and you’re your own company, this is a pretty solid option. However, a Solo 401(k) typically requires more advance planning and ongoing paperwork than other account types. If your circumstances change, you may be able to roll over your Solo 401(k) plan or consolidate your IRAs into a more appropriate retirement savings account. Simplified Employee Pension (SEP IRA) With a SEP IRA, the business sets up an IRA for each employee. Only the employer can contribute, and the contribution rate must be the same for each qualifying employee. Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE IRA) A SIMPLE IRA is ideal for small business owners who have 100 employees or less. Both the employer and the employee can contribute. You can also contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA—although how much you can contribute depends on how much you’ve put into other retirement accounts.

      Investing in Your 50s: 4 Practical Tips for Retirement Planning  In your 50s, assess your retirement plan, lifestyle, earnings, and support for family. Practice goal-based investing to help meet your objectives. As you enter your 50s, you may feel like your long-term goals are coming within reach, and it’s up to you to make sure those objectives are realized. Now is also a perfect time to see how your investments and retirement savings are shaping up. If you’ve cut back on savings to meet big expenses, such as home repairs and (if you have children) college tuition, you now have an opportunity to make up lost ground. You might also think about how you want to live after you retire. Will you relocate? Will you downsize or stay put? If you have children, how much are you willing to support them as they enter adulthood? These decisions all matter when deciding how to strategize your investments for this important decade of your life. Four Goals for Your 50s Your 50s can be a truly productive and efficient time for your investments. Focus on achieving these four key goals to make these years truly count in retirement. Goal 1: Assess Your Retirement Accounts If you’ve put retirement savings on the back burner, or just want to make a push for greater financial security—the good news is that you can make larger contributions toward employer retirement accounts (401(k), 403(b), etc.) at age 50 and over, thanks to the IRS rules on catch-up contributions. If you’re already contributing the maximum to your employer plans and still want to save more for retirement, consider opening a traditional or Roth IRA. These are individual retirement accounts that are subject to their own contribution limits, but also allow for a catch-up contribution at age 50 or older. You may also wish to simplify your investments by consolidating your retirement accounts with IRA rollovers. Doing so can help you get more organized, streamline recordkeeping and make it easier to implement an overall retirement strategy. Plus, by consolidating now, you can help avoid complications after age 72, when you’ll have to make Required Minimum Distributions from all the tax-deferred retirement accounts you own. Goal 2: Evaluate Your Lifestyle and Pre-Retirement Finances When you’re in your 50s, you may still be a ways from retirement, however you’ll want to consider how to support yourself when you do begin that stage of your life. If you’ve just begun calculating how much you’ll need to save for a comfortable retirement, consider the following tips and tools. Tips and Tools for Estimating Income Needs Make a rough estimate of how much you spend on housing, food, utilities, health care, clothing, and incidentals. Nowadays, tools such as Mint® and Prosper include budgeting features that can help you see these expenditures. Subtract what you can expect to receive from Social Security. You can estimate your benefit with this calculator. Subtract any defined pension plan benefits or other sources of income you expect to receive in retirement. Subtract what you can safely withdraw each year from your retirement savings. Consider robust retirement planning tools, which can help you understand how much you’ll need to save for a comfortable retirement based on current and future income from all sources, and even your location. If there’s a gap between your income needs and your anticipated retirement income, you may need to make adjustments in the form of cutting expenses, working more years before retiring, increasing the current amounts you’re investing for retirement, and re-evaluating your investment strategy. Think About Taxes Your income may peak in your 50s, which can also push you into higher tax brackets. This makes tax-saving strategies like these potentially more valuable than ever: Putting more into tax-advantaged investing vehicles like 401(k)s or traditional IRAs. Donating appreciated assets to charities. Implementing tax-efficient investment strategies within your investments, such as tax loss harvesting* and asset location. Betterment automates both of these strategies and offers features to customers with no additional management fee. Define Your Lifestyle Your 50s are a great time to think about your current and desired lifestyle. As you near retirement, you’ll want to continue doing the things you love to do, or perhaps be able to start doing more and build on those passions. Perhaps you know you’ll be traveling more frequently. If you are socially active and enjoy entertainment activities such as dining out and going to the theater, those interests likely won’t change. Instead, you’ll want to enjoy doing all the things you love to do, but with the peace of mind knowing that you won’t be infringing on your retirement reserves. Say you want to start a new business when you leave your job. You’re not alone; more than a third of new entrepreneurs starting businesses in 2021 were between the ages of 55 and 64 according to research by the Kauffman Foundation. To get ready, you’ll want to start building or leveraging your contacts, creating a business plan, and setting up a workspace. You may also wish to consider relocating during retirement. Living in a warmer part of the country or moving closer to family is certainly appealing. Downsizing to a smaller home or even an apartment could cut down on utilities, property taxes, and maintenance. You might need one car instead of two—or none at all—if you relocate to a neighborhood surrounded by amenities within walking distance. If you sell your primary home, you can take advantage of a break on capital gains —even if you don’t use the money to buy another one. If you’ve lived in the same house for at least two out of the last five years, you can exclude capital gains of up to $250,000 per individual and $500,000 per married couple from your income taxes, according to the IRS. Goal 3: Chart Your Pre-Retirement Investment Strategy After you’ve determined how much you’ll need for a comfortable retirement, now’s also a good time to begin thinking about how you’ll use the assets you’ve accumulated to generate income after you retire. If you have shorter-term financial objectives over the next two to five years—such as paying for your kids’ college tuition, or a major home repair—you’ll have to plan accordingly. For these milestones, consider goal-based investing, where each goal will have different exposure to market risk depending on the time allocated for reaching that goal. Goal-based investing matches your time horizon to your asset allocation, which means you take on an appropriate amount of risk for your respective goals. Investments for short-term goals may be better allocated to less volatile assets such as bonds, while longer-term goals have the ability to absorb greater risks but also achieve greater returns. When you misallocate, it can lead to saving too much or too little, missing out on returns with too conservative an allocation, or missing your goal if you take on too much risk. Setting long investment goals shouldn’t be taken lightly. This is a moment of self-evaluation. In order to invest for the future, you must cut back on spending your wealth now. That means tomorrow’s goals in retirement must outweigh the pleasures of today’s spending. If you’re a Betterment customer, it’s easy to get started with goal-based investing. Simply set up a goal with your desired time horizon and target balance and Betterment will recommend an investment approach tailored to this information. Goal 4: Set Clear Expectations with Children If you have children, there’s nothing more satisfying than watching your kids turn into motivated adults with passions to pursue. As a parent, you’ll naturally want to prepare them with everything you can to help them succeed in the world. You may be wrapping up paying for their college tuition, which is no easy feat given that these costs – even at public in-state universities – now average in the tens of thousands of dollars per year. As your kids move through college, take the time to have a serious discussion with them about what they plan to do after graduation. If graduate school is on the horizon, talk to them about how they’ll pay for it and how much help from you, if any, they can expect. Unlike undergraduate programs, graduate programs assess financial aid requirements by looking at only the student’s assets and incomes, not the parents’, so your finances won't be considered. You’ll also want to set expectations about other kinds of support—such as any help in paying for their health insurance premiums up to a certain age, or their mobile phone plan, or even whether toward major purchases like a home or car. It’s great to help out your children, but you’ll want to make sure you’re not jeopardizing your own security. Your 50s may demand a lot from you, but taking the time to properly assess your investments, personal financial situation, lifestyle, and, if applicable, your support for children, can be truly rewarding in your retirement years. By tackling these four goals now, you can help set yourself up to meet your current responsibilities and increase your chances of a more financially secure and comfortable life in the decades to come.

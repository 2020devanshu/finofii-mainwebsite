<p>Betterment Financial, LLC (“Betterment”) uses the DOSH Holdings, Inc. (“DOSH,” “our,” “we”) cash-back platform to manage the Betterment cash back rewards Powered by DOSH® program (the “Program”). DOSH is a third party that is not affiliated with nbkc bank (“nbkc”) or Betterment. By participating in the Program, you agree that DOSH may create a wallet for you on its platform in order for you to earn and redeem rewards based on qualifying transactions with participating merchants (the “Services”). These Betterment Cash Back Rewards Powered by DOSH Terms of Service (the “DOSH Terms”) govern your use of the DOSH platform. You may opt out of this Program at any time by emailing Betterment customer support at cashback@betterment.com.</p>
<h3>1. Your acceptance of these Betterment Cash Back Rewards Powered by Dosh Terms of Service</h3>
<p>By accessing or using the Services in any way or by clicking to agree to these DOSH Terms (or any agreement that has incorporated these DOSH Terms) when that option is made available to you, you agree to be bound by these DOSH Terms and the DOSH Privacy Policy which is incorporated by this reference into these DOSH Terms. If you do not agree to all the DOSH Terms, do not access or use the Services. You may opt-out of cash back rewards at any time by emailing Betterment customer support at cashback@betterment.com.</p>
<h3>2. The Services</h3>
<p>The purpose of the Services is to help you save money with minimal effort by rewarding you for certain qualifying purchases and other activities. The DOSH Privacy Policy governs our collection, use, storage, and disclosure of user information. DOSH is in no way affiliated with the merchants that extend offers to you through the Program. Subject to these DOSH Terms, we will automatically provide rewards to you when you purchase qualifying goods or services at participating merchants with your eligible Betterment Visa Debit Card. DOSH, in its sole discretion, establishes the terms and conditions for each qualifying purchase or action and determines whether you have satisfied such terms and conditions to receive the associated rewards. The following transaction types are never eligible to receive rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li>ATM transactions;</li>
<li>In-store cash withdrawals or cash back;</li>
<li>Any transactions identified by a merchant as not being eligible to receive rewards;</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon the closure of your Betterment Checking Account or Betterment Visa® Debit Card, rewards on any transactions that are unsettled or unpaid shall be cancelled. All offers made available to you are temporary and may become unavailable without notice.</p>
<p>Without limiting any of the other terms of these DOSH Terms, if you return, charge back, cancel, dispute, or otherwise request a refund for a qualifying purchase for which you have already received rewards, we reserve the right to remove any rewards from the Betterment Checking Account linked to your eligible Betterment Visa Debit Card (your “cash back rewards Account”) or withhold future cash back rewards Powered by DOSH to offset any such amount.</p>
<p>Any cash back rewards that you earn will be transferred to your cash back rewards Account. You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy and completeness of any rewards transferred to your cash back rewards Account. All rewards received are exclusive of any applicable withholding, sales, use, excise, value added, or other taxes. You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for determining, paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services. We are not responsible for determining whether you owe taxes in connection with your access to or use of the Services or for collecting, reporting, or remitting taxes arising from your access to or use of the Services, except for our own income taxes.</p>
<p>In addition to your other representations and warranties in these DOSH Terms, you represent and warrant that you will not access or use the Services to engage in any illegal, fraudulent, or other illicit activity.</p>
<h3>3. Ownership and Property Rights in the Services</h3>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that the Services are protected by applicable copyright, patent, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. All words and logos displayed in connection with the Services that are marked by the ™ or ® symbols are trademarks and service marks of DOSH and/or their respective owners. The display of a third-party trademark in connection with the Services does not mean that we have any relationship with that third party or that such third party endorses the Services or DOSH.</p>
<h3>4. Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>These DOSH Terms, including the DOSH Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Services. These DOSH Terms may not be modified, supplemented, qualified, or interpreted by any trade usage or prior course of dealing not expressly made a part of these DOSH Terms. We may, without prior notice or liability to you, discontinue the Services or modify the Services by adding or removing features or functionalities, even though such changes may affect rewards awarded to you. We may also revise these DOSH Terms from time to time in our sole discretion, subject to applicable law. When we revise these DOSH Terms, we will update this document to reflect those changes. You are free to decide whether or not to accept a revised version of these DOSH Terms, but accepting these DOSH Terms, as revised, is required for your continued access to and use of the Services. If you do not agree to these DOSH Terms or any revised version of these DOSH Terms, you may opt out of the program by emailing Betterment customer support at cashback@betterment.com. Except as otherwise expressly stated by us, your access to and use of the Services are subject to the version of these DOSH Terms in effect at the time of your access or use.</p>
<p>These DOSH Terms and any rights hereunder may not be transferred or assigned by you without our prior written consent but may be assigned by us without restriction and without your prior consent. Any attempted transfer or assignment by you without our prior written consent will be null and void. No agency, joint venture, partnership, trust, or employment relationship is created between you and us by way of these DOSH Terms.</p>
<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<h3>4. How we use and share information</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or the DOSH Terms, we will use personal information, payment method and transaction information solely as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 1.8rem;">to confirm a qualifying purchase for the purpose of matching transactions to confirm whether you qualify for an offer or statement credit;</span></li>
<li>to create a record of the transaction information and thereafter maintain and use data in connection with the Services;</li>
<li>to conduct analysis for the improvement and optimization of the Services to improve the user experience by using IP addresses to determine user location to inform participating merchants where a transaction occurred as needed for the merchant to confirm a specific transaction occurred or points rewards should be awarded;</li>
<li>to provide participating merchants aggregated and anonymized information relating specifically to payment method activity solely to allow participating merchants to assess the results of their campaign;</li>
<li>to provide information in order to respond to a request from a government authority or a payment organization involved in a transaction with you or a merchant; and</li>
<li>to enable the sharing, exchange and use of transaction information described above and herein by and among us, the payment networks, applicable third-party service providers and applicable merchants.</li>

      Are 401(k) Contributions Tax Deductible for Employers?  Seize the tax deductions (and credits!). Contributing to employees’ 401(k) accounts may cost less than you think. Vehicle expenses. Salaries. Office supplies. Rent. Utilities. Many business expenses can be claimed as tax deductions. But did you know that 401(k) plan contributions offer significant tax benefits, too? Read on to discover all the ways you can save on your tax bill. Snag the tax deductions Great news! Whether you decide to make employer matching contributions, profit sharing contributions, or safe harbor contributions to employee retirement accounts, they’re tax deductible. That means that you can subtract the value from your company’s taxable income. According to the IRS, employer contributions are deductible as long as they “don’t exceed the limitations described in section 404 of the Internal Revenue Code.” Wondering about the limits? Well, in 2020 the employer contribution limit is 25% of an employee’s compensation (eligible compensation is limited to $285,000 per participant). In addition, combined employer and employee contributions are limited to the lessor of $57,000 or 100% of the employee’s annual compensation. The tax benefits don’t end there… In addition to claiming big deductions by making employer contributions to your retirement plan, you can also save on taxes in a multitude of other ways. 1. 401(k) administration fees—Administrative fees are typically a business tax deduction. So not only does paying for administrative fees reduce the amount that comes out of individual 401(k) accounts, but they qualify as a business expense, thus reducing your business taxable income. 2. SECURE Act tax credits—Thanks to the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019 (the SECURE Act), you may be eligible for valuable tax credits for small employers. Even more valuable than a tax deduction, a tax credit subtracts the value from the taxes you owe! Plus, you can claim these credits for the first three years the plan or feature is in place: Tax credit for new plans—You may now be able to claim annual tax credits of 50% of the cost to establish and administer a retirement savings plan, up to the greater of: &nbsp;$500; or &nbsp;the lesser of: $250 per eligible non-highly compensated employee eligible for the plan; and $5,000. (Up to $15,000 in tax credits over three years!) Tax credit for adding eligible automatic enrollment—Earn an additional $500 annual tax credit for adding an eligible automatic enrollment feature to your new or existing plan. (Up to $1,500 in tax credits over three years!) 3. Benefit from your own contributions—Plan on contributing to your own 401(k) plan? You’ll save on your own taxes, too! In 2020, you can contribute up to $19,500 to your 401(k), and if you’re age 50 or older, you can make additional catch-up contributions of up to $6,500. Select either: Traditional 401(k) contributions with pretax dollars to enjoy the benefits of tax-deferred saving; or Roth 401(k) contributions with post-tax dollars, enabling you to make tax-free withdrawals in retirement Plus, offering your employees matching, profit-sharing, or safe harbor contributions may mean that you can increase your own personal contributions. That’s because, due to the mechanics of discrimination testing, higher 401(k) contributions made by non-highly compensated employees may help to increase allowable contributions for highly compensated employees. Learn more now. Reward your employees (and improve your company’s productivity) In addition to helping retain existing employees, a match is a powerful recruitment tool. In fact, a recent Betterment for Business study found that, for more than 45 percent of respondents, an employer’s decision to offer a 401(k) match was a factor in whether or not they took the job. Plus, you’d be surprised at the hidden costs of not offering an employer contribution. Just look at employee replacement and retention costs. When employers do not help facilitate employee retirement planning, they may be surprised by other costs that could rise, including higher relative salaries (beyond what might have been planned for), higher healthcare costs, or costs associated with loss of productivity. If the connection seems hard to believe, take a look at the research. According to a study from Prudential, every year an employee delays their retirement, it can cost their employer more than $50,000 due to a combination of factors including higher relative salaries, higher health care costs, younger employee retention through promotion, and several other elements. For companies that may be less concerned with an aging employee population, forgoing matches can still contribute to rising retention and replacement costs due to the impact of financial distress on employee performance. In a survey by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), which measured the impact of personal financial stress on employee performance, 47% of HR professionals noticed that employees struggle with their “ability to focus on work.” Poor productivity not only costs the business in output, but can inevitably lead to higher employee turnover, which can lead to higher costs associated with retention and hiring. Make a smart compensation decision Are you debating between giving employees a raise and offering them a 401(k) plan contribution? Consider this example using $3,000. A $3,000 increase in base pay will mean a net increase to the employee of just $2,250, assuming 25% in income taxes and FICA combined. For the employer, that increase will cost $2,422.12, after FICA adjusted for a 25% in income tax rate. Employee Income After-Tax Employer Net Cost $3,000.00 Increased Pay $3,000.00 Increased Payroll ($750.00) Taxes @ 25% $229.50 FICA @ 7.65% &nbsp; &nbsp; ($807.38) Tax Deduction @ 25% $2,250.00 Net Paycheck $2,422.12 Net Cost Alternatively, a $3,000 contribution to an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan results in no FICA for either the employee or the employer.&nbsp; The employee would receive the full benefit of that $3,000 today on a pre-tax basis PLUS it would grow tax-free until retirement. As the employer, your tax deduction on that 401(k) contribution would be $750, meaning your cost is just $2,250 —or 7% less than if you had provided a $3,000 salary increase. Betterment can help boost tax savings even more... After you set up your 401(k) plan with Betterment, your employees can start investing for retirement and save on current taxes if they decide to save on a pre-tax basis. But Betterment provides additional tax saving strategies for those employees with two or more Betterment account types (including pre-tax 401(k) and Roth 401(k), but also a retail account) can have their investments optimized by using our Tax Coordination feature at no additional cost. This strategy generally places your least tax-efficient assets in your tax-advantaged accounts (like pre-tax 401(k)s), which already have big tax breaks, while diverting the most tax-efficient assets to your taxable accounts. …And help you take care of the paperwork You may be wondering: “Do I need to report 401(k) contributions?” The answer is “yes.” Specifically,&nbsp; employees’ contributions must be reported on their Form W2, Wage and Tax Statement, and Form W-3, Transmittal of Wage &amp; Tax Statement. In addition, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), you are required to fulfill specific 401(k) plan reporting requirements, which include detailing employer and employee 401(k) contributions. While the paperwork can be complicated, an experienced 401(k) provider like Betterment can guide you through the process. Take the next step If you’re ready to get started, Betterment makes it easy for you to offer your employees a better 401(k) at a fraction of the cost of most providers. As your full-service 401(k) partner, we can help you: Design a plan with compelling features like automatic enrollment and employer contributions Select and monitor plan investments (Betterment assumes full responsibility as a 3(38) investment manager) Offer your employees personalized guidance to help them make strides toward their long- and short-term goals ranging from saving for retirement to paying down debt Manage important compliance and reporting requirements A Betterment 401(k) plan could be better for you—and better for your employees.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Everything You Need to Know About 401(k) Blackout Periods Maybe you’ve heard of a 401(k) blackout period, but if you don’t know exactly what it is or how to explain it to your employees, read on. You’ve probably heard of a 401(k) plan blackout period – but do you know what it is and how to explain it to your employees? Read on for answers to the most frequently asked questions about blackout periods. What is a blackout period? A blackout period is a time when participants are not able to access their 401(k) accounts because a major plan change is being made. During this time, they are not allowed to direct their investments, change their contribution rate or amount, make transfers, or take loans or distributions. However, plan assets remain invested during the blackout period. In addition, participants can continue to make contributions and loan repayments, which will continue to be invested according to the latest elections on file. Participants will be able to see these inflows and any earnings in their accounts once the blackout period has ended. When is a blackout period necessary? Typically, a blackout period is necessary when: 401(k) plan assets and records are being moved from one retirement plan provider to another &nbsp;New employees are added to a company’s plan during a merger or acquisition Available investment options are being modified Blackout periods are a normal and necessary part of 401(k) administration during such events to ensure that records and assets are accurately accounted for and reconciled. In these circumstances, participant accounts must be valued (and potentially liquidated) so that funds can be reinvested in new options. In the event of a plan provider change, the former provider must formally pass the data and assets to the new plan provider. Therefore, accounts must be frozen on a temporary basis before the transition. How long does a blackout period last? A blackout period usually lasts about 10 business days. However, it may need to be extended due to unforeseen circumstances, which are rare; but there is no legal maximum limit for a blackout period. Regardless, you must give advance notice to your employees that a blackout is on the horizon. What kind of notice do I have to give my employees about a blackout period? Is your blackout going to last for more than three days? If so, you’re required by federal law to send a written notice of the blackout period to all of your plan participants and beneficiaries. The notice must be sent at least 30 days – but no more than 60 days – prior to the start of the blackout. Typically, your plan provider will provide you with language so that you can send an appropriate blackout notice to your plan participants. If you are moving your plan from another provider to Betterment, we will coordinate with your previous recordkeeper to establish a timeline for the transfer, including the timing and expected duration of the blackout period. Betterment will draft a blackout notice on your behalf to provide to your employees, which will include the following: Reason for the blackout Identification of any investments subject to the blackout period Description of the rights otherwise available to participants and beneficiaries under the plan that will be temporarily suspended, limited, or restricted The expected beginning and ending date of the blackout A statement that participants should evaluate the appropriateness of their current investment decisions in light of their inability to direct or diversify assets during the blackout period If at least 30 days-notice cannot be given, an explanation of why advance notice could not be provided The name, address, and telephone number of the plan administrator or other individual who can answer questions about the blackout Who should receive the blackout notice? All plan participants with a balance should receive the blackout notice, regardless of their employment status with your company. In addition, we suggest sending the notice to eligible active employees, even if they currently don’t have a balance, since they may wish to start contributing and should be made aware of the upcoming blackout period. What should I say if my employees are concerned about an upcoming blackout period? Reassure your employees that a blackout period is normal and that it’s a necessary event that happens when significant plan changes are made. Also, encourage them to look at their accounts and make any changes they see fit prior to the start of the blackout period. Thinking about changing plan providers? If you’re thinking about changing plan providers, but are concerned about the ramifications of a blackout period, know that Betterment is here to help. Our team is here to guide you through the process, and we are committed to making the transition as seamless as possible for you and your participants.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Understanding 401(k) Fees Come retirement time, the number of 401(k) plan fees charged can make a major difference in your employees’ account balances—and their futures. Did&nbsp;you know that the smallest 401(k) plans often pay the most in fees? We believe that you don’t have to pay high fees to provide your employees with a top-notch 401(k) plan. In fact, Betterment offers comprehensive plan solutions at one of the lowest costs in the industry. Why do 401(k) fees matter? The difference between a 1% fee and a 2% fee may not sound like much, but in reality, higher 401(k) fees can take a major bite out of your participants’ retirement savings. Consider this example: Triplets Jane, Julie, and Janet each began investing in their employers’ 401(k) plan at the age of 25. Each had a starting salary of $50,000, increased by 3% annually, and contributed 6% of their pre-tax salary with no company matching contribution. Their investments returned 6% annually. The only difference is that their retirement accounts were charged annual 401(k) fees of 1%, 1.5%, and 2%, respectively. Forty years later, they’re all thinking about retiring and decide to compare their account balances. Here’s what they look like: &nbsp; Annual 401(k) fee Account balance at age 65 Jane 1% $577,697 Julie 1.5% $517,856 Janet 2% $465,894 Information is hypothetical and provided for educational purposes only. As such, these figures do not reflect Betterment’s management fee and do not reflect any actual client performance As you can see, come retirement time, the amount of fees charged can make a major difference in your employees’ account balances—and their futures. Why should employers care about 401(k) fees? You care about your employees, so naturally, you want to help them build brighter futures. But beyond that, it’s your fiduciary duty as a plan sponsor to make sure you’re only paying reasonable 401(k) fees for services that are necessary for your plan. The Department of Labor (DOL) outlines rules that you must follow to fulfill this fiduciary responsibility, including “ensuring that the services provided to the plan are necessary and that the cost of those services is reasonable” and has published a guide to assist you in this process. Generally, any firm providing services of $1,000 or more to your 401(k) plan is required to provide a fee disclosure, which is the first step in understanding your plan’s fees and expenses. It’s important to note that the regulations do not require you to ensure your fees are the lowest available, but that they are reasonable given the level and quality of service and support you and your employees receive. Benchmark the fees against similar retirement plans (by number of employees and plan assets, for example) to see if they’re reasonable.&nbsp; What are the main types of fees? Typically, 401(k) fees fall into three categories: administrative fees, individual service fees, and investment fees. Let’s dig a little deeper into each category: Plan administration fees—Paid to your 401(k) provider, plan administration fees typically cover 401(k) set-up fees, as well as general expenses such as recordkeeping, communications, support, legal, and trustee services. These costs are often assessed as a flat annual fee. Investment fees—Investment fees, typically assessed as a percentage of assets under management, may take two forms: fund fees that are expressed as an expense ratio or percentage of assets, and investment advisory fees for portfolio construction and the ongoing management of the plan assets. Betterment, for instance, acts as investment advisor to its 401(k) clients, assuming full fiduciary responsibility for the selection and monitoring of funds. And as is also the case with Betterment, the investment advisory fee may even include personalized investment advice for every employee. Individual service fees—If participants elect certain services—such as taking out a 401(k) loan—they may be assessed individual fees for each service. Wondering what you and your employees are paying in 401(k) fees? Fund fees are detailed in the funds’ prospectuses and are often wrapped up into one figure known as the expense ratio, expressed as a percentage of assets. Other fees are described in agreements with your service providers. High quality, low fees Typically, mutual funds have dominated the retirement investment landscape, but in recent years, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become increasingly popular. At Betterment, we believe that a portfolio of ETFs, in conjunction with personalized, unbiased advice, is the ideal solution for today’s retirement savers. Who pays 401(k) fees: the employer or the participant? The short answer is that it depends. As the employer, you may have options with respect to whether certain fees may be allocated to plan participants. Expenses incurred as a result of plan-related business expenses (so-called “ settlor expenses”) cannot be paid from plan assets. An example of such an expense would be a consulting fee related to the decision to offer a plan in the first place. Other costs associated with plan administration are eligible to be charged to plan assets. Of course, just because certain expenses can be paid by plan assets doesn’t mean you are off the hook in monitoring them and ensuring they remain reasonable. Plan administration fees are often paid by the employer. While it could be a significant financial responsibility for you as the business owner, there are three significant upsides: &nbsp; Reduced fiduciary liability—As you read, paying excessive fees is a major source of fiduciary liability. If you pay for the fees from a corporate account, you reduce potential liability. &nbsp; Lowered income taxes—If your company pays for the administration fees, they’re tax deductible! Plus, you can potentially save even more with the new SECURE Act tax credits for starting a new plan and for adding automatic enrollment. &nbsp; Increased 401(k) returns—Do you take part in your own 401(k) plan? If so, paying 401(k) fees from company assets means you’ll be keeping more of your personal retirement savings. Fund fees are tied to the individual investment options in each participant’s portfolio. Therefore, these fees are paid from each participant’s plan assets. Individual service fees are also paid directly by investors who elect the service, for example, taking a plan loan. How can you minimize your 401(k) fees? Minimizing your fees starts with the 401(k) provider you choose. In the past, the price for 401(k) plan administration was quite high. However, things have changed, and now the era of expensive, impersonal, unguided retirement saving is over. Innovative companies like Betterment now offer comprehensive plan solutions at a fraction of the cost of most providers. Betterment combines the power of efficient technology with personalized advice so that employers can provide a benefit that’s truly a benefit, and employees can know that they’re invested correctly for retirement. No hidden fees. Maximum transparency. Costs are often passed to the employee through fund fees, and in fact, mutual fund pricing structures incorporate non-investment fees that can be used to pay for other types of expenses. Because they are embedded in mutual fund expense ratios, they may not be explicit, therefore making it difficult for you to know exactly how much you and your employees are paying. In other words, most mutual funds in 401(k) plans contain hidden fees. At Betterment, we believe in transparency. Our use of ETFs means there are no hidden fees, so you and your employees are able to know how much you’re paying for the underlying investments themselves. Plus, our pricing structure unbundles the key offerings we provide—advisory, investment, record keeping, and compliance—and assigns a fee to each service. A clearly defined fee structure means no surprises for you—and more money working harder for your employees.

    <a class="item" href="resources/what-is-a-qualified-default-investment-alternative-qdia.html">What is a 401(k) QDIA?</a>
    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      What is a 401(k) QDIA? A QDIA (Qualified Default Investment Alternative) is the plan’s default investment. When money is contributed to the plan, it’s automatically invested in the QDIA. What is a QDIA? A 401(k) QDIA (Qualified Default Investment Alternative) is the investment used when an employee contributes to the plan without having specified how the money should be invested. As a "safe harbor," a QDIA relieves the employer from liability should the QDIA suffer investment losses. Here’s how it works: When money is contributed to the plan, it’s automatically invested in the QDIA that was selected by the plan fiduciary (typically, the business owner or the plan sponsor). The employee can leave the money in the QDIA or transfer it to another plan investment. When (and why) was the QDIA introduced? The concept of a QDIA was first introduced when the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) was signed into law. Designed to boost employee retirement savings, the PPA removed barriers that prevented employers from adopting automatic enrollment. At the time, fears about legal liability for market fluctuations and the applicability of state wage withholding laws had prevented many employers from adopting automatic enrollment—or had led them to select low-risk, low-return options as default investments. The PPA eliminated those fears by amending the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to provide a safe harbor for plan fiduciaries who invest participant assets in certain types of default investment alternatives when participants do not give investment direction. To assist employers in selecting QDIAs that met employees’ long-term retirement needs, the Department of Labor (DOL) issued a final regulation detailing the characteristics of these investments. Learn more about what kinds of investments qualify as QDIAs below. Why does having a QDIA matter? When a 401(k) plan has a QDIA that meets the DOL’s rules, then the plan fiduciary is not liable for the QDIA’s investment performance. Without a QDIA, the plan fiduciary is potentially liable for investment losses when participants don’t actively direct their plan investments. Plus, having a QDIA in place means that employee accounts are well positioned—even if an active investment decision is never taken. If you select an appropriate default investment for your plan, you can feel confident knowing that your employees’ retirement dollars are invested in a vehicle that offers the potential for growth. Does my retirement plan need a QDIA? Yes, it’s a smart idea for all plans to have a QDIA. That’s because, at some point, money may be contributed to the plan, and participants may not have an investment election on file. This could happen in a number of situations, including when money is contributed to an account but no active investment elections have been established, such as when an employer makes a contribution but an employee isn’t contributing to the plan; or when an employee rolls money into the 401(k) plan prior to making investment elections. It makes sense then, that plans with automatic enrollment must have a QDIA. Are there any other important QDIA regulations that I need to know about? Yes, the DOL details several conditions plan sponsors must follow in order to obtain safe harbor relief from fiduciary liability for investment outcomes, including: A notice generally must be provided to participants and beneficiaries in advance of their first QDIA investment, and then on an annual basis after that Information about the QDIA must be provided to participants and beneficiaries which must include the following: An explanation of the employee’s rights under the plan to designate how the contributions will be invested; An explanation of how assets will be invested if no action taken regarding investment election; Description of the actual QDIA, which includes the investment objectives, characteristics of risk and return, and any fees and expenses involved Participants and beneficiaries must have the opportunity to direct investments out of a QDIA as frequently as other plan investments, but at least quarterly For more information, consult the DOL fact sheet. What kinds of investments qualify as QDIAs? The DOL regulations don’t identify specific investment products. Instead, they describe mechanisms for investing participant contributions in a way that meets long-term retirement saving needs. Specifically, there are four types of QDIAs: An investment service that allocates contributions among existing plan options to provide an asset mix that takes into account the individual’s age or retirement date (for example, a professionally managed account like the one offered by Betterment) A product with a mix of investments that takes into account the individual’s age or retirement date (for example, a life-cycle or target-date fund) A product with a mix of investments that takes into account the characteristics of the group of employees as a whole, rather than each individual (for example, a balanced fund) The fourth type of QDIA is a capital preservation product, such as a stable value fund, that can only be used for the first 120 days of participation. This may be an option for Eligible Automatic Contribution Arrangement (EACA) plans that allow withdrawals of unintended deferrals within the first 90 days without penalty. We’re excluding further discussion of this option here since plans must still have one of the other QDIAs in cases where the participant takes no action within the first 120 days. What are the pros and cons of each type of QDIA? Let’s breakdown each of the first three QDIAs: 1. An investment service that allocates contributions among existing plan options to provide an asset mix that takes into account the individual’s age or retirement date Such an investment service, or managed account, is often preferred as a QDIA over the other options because they can be much more personalized. This is the QDIA provided as part of Betterment 401(k)s. Betterment factors in more than just age (or years to retirement) when assigning participants their particular stock-to-bond ratio within our Core portfolios. We utilize specific data including salary, balance, state of residence, plan rules, and more. And while managed accounts can be pricey, they don’t have to be. Betterment’s solution, which is relatively lower in cost due to investing in exchange traded funds (ETFs) portfolios, offers personalized advice and an easy-to-use platform that can also take external and spousal/partner accounts into consideration. 2. A product with a mix of investments that takes into account the individual’s age or retirement date When QDIAs were introduced in 2006, target date funds were the preferred default investment. The concept is simple: pick the target date fund with the year that most closely matches the year the investor plans to retire. For example, in 2020 if the investor is 45 and retirement is 20 years away, the 2040 Target Date Fund would be selected. As the investor moves closer to their retirement date, the fund adjusts its asset mix to become more conservative. One common criticism of target date funds today is that the personalization ends there. Target date funds are too simple and their one-size-fits-all portfolio allocations do not serve any individual investor very well. Plus, target date funds are often far more expensive compared to other alternatives. Finally, most target date funds are composed of investments from the same company—and very few fund companies excel at investing across every sector and asset class. Many experts view target date funds as outdated QDIAs and less desirable than managed accounts. 3. A product with a mix of investments that takes into account the characteristics of the group of employees as a whole&nbsp; This kind of product—for example, a balanced fund—offers a mix of equity and fixed-income investments. However, it’s based on group demographics and not on the retirement needs of individual participants. Therefore, using a balanced fund as a QDIA is a blunt instrument that by definition will have an investment mix that is either too heavily weighted to one asset class or another for most participants in your plan. Better QDIAs—and better 401(k) plans Betterment provides tailored allocation advice based on what each individual investor needs. That means greater personalization—and potentially greater investment results—for your employees. At Betterment, we monitor plan participants’ investing progress to make sure they’re on track to reach their goals. When they’re not on target, we provide actionable advice to help get them back on track. As a 3(38) investment manager, we assume full responsibility for selecting and monitoring plan investments—including your QDIA. That means fiduciary relief for you and better results for your employees. The exchange-traded fund (ETF) difference Another key component that sets Betterment apart from the competition is our exclusive use of ETFs. Here's why we use them: Low cost—ETFs generally cost less than mutual funds, which means more money stays invested. Diversified—All of the portfolios used by Betterment are designed with diversification in mind, so that investors are not overly exposed to individual stocks, bonds, sectors, or countries—which may mean better returns in the long run. Efficient—ETFs take advantage of decades of technological advances in buying, selling, and pricing securities. Helping your employees live better Our mission is simple: to empower people to do what’s best for their money so they can live better. Betterment’s suite of financial wellness solutions, from our QDIAs to our user-friendly investment platform, is designed to give your employees a more personalized experience.

    <p class="item-title">Are 401(k) Contributions Tax Deductible for Employers?</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Are 401(k) Contributions Tax Deductible for Employers?  Seize the tax deductions (and credits!). Contributing to employees’ 401(k) accounts may cost less than you think. Vehicle expenses. Salaries. Office supplies. Rent. Utilities. Many business expenses can be claimed as tax deductions. But did you know that 401(k) plan contributions offer significant tax benefits, too? Read on to discover all the ways you can save on your tax bill. Snag the tax deductions Great news! Whether you decide to make employer matching contributions, profit sharing contributions, or safe harbor contributions to employee retirement accounts, they’re tax deductible. That means that you can subtract the value from your company’s taxable income. According to the IRS, employer contributions are deductible as long as they “don’t exceed the limitations described in section 404 of the Internal Revenue Code.” Wondering about the limits? Well, in 2020 the employer contribution limit is 25% of an employee’s compensation (eligible compensation is limited to $285,000 per participant). In addition, combined employer and employee contributions are limited to the lessor of $57,000 or 100% of the employee’s annual compensation. The tax benefits don’t end there… In addition to claiming big deductions by making employer contributions to your retirement plan, you can also save on taxes in a multitude of other ways. 1. 401(k) administration fees—Administrative fees are typically a business tax deduction. So not only does paying for administrative fees reduce the amount that comes out of individual 401(k) accounts, but they qualify as a business expense, thus reducing your business taxable income. 2. SECURE Act tax credits—Thanks to the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019 (the SECURE Act), you may be eligible for valuable tax credits for small employers. Even more valuable than a tax deduction, a tax credit subtracts the value from the taxes you owe! Plus, you can claim these credits for the first three years the plan or feature is in place: Tax credit for new plans—You may now be able to claim annual tax credits of 50% of the cost to establish and administer a retirement savings plan, up to the greater of: &nbsp;$500; or &nbsp;the lesser of: $250 per eligible non-highly compensated employee eligible for the plan; and $5,000. (Up to $15,000 in tax credits over three years!) Tax credit for adding eligible automatic enrollment—Earn an additional $500 annual tax credit for adding an eligible automatic enrollment feature to your new or existing plan. (Up to $1,500 in tax credits over three years!) 3. Benefit from your own contributions—Plan on contributing to your own 401(k) plan? You’ll save on your own taxes, too! In 2020, you can contribute up to $19,500 to your 401(k), and if you’re age 50 or older, you can make additional catch-up contributions of up to $6,500. Select either: Traditional 401(k) contributions with pretax dollars to enjoy the benefits of tax-deferred saving; or Roth 401(k) contributions with post-tax dollars, enabling you to make tax-free withdrawals in retirement Plus, offering your employees matching, profit-sharing, or safe harbor contributions may mean that you can increase your own personal contributions. That’s because, due to the mechanics of discrimination testing, higher 401(k) contributions made by non-highly compensated employees may help to increase allowable contributions for highly compensated employees. Learn more now. Reward your employees (and improve your company’s productivity) In addition to helping retain existing employees, a match is a powerful recruitment tool. In fact, a recent Betterment for Business study found that, for more than 45 percent of respondents, an employer’s decision to offer a 401(k) match was a factor in whether or not they took the job. Plus, you’d be surprised at the hidden costs of not offering an employer contribution. Just look at employee replacement and retention costs. When employers do not help facilitate employee retirement planning, they may be surprised by other costs that could rise, including higher relative salaries (beyond what might have been planned for), higher healthcare costs, or costs associated with loss of productivity. If the connection seems hard to believe, take a look at the research. According to a study from Prudential, every year an employee delays their retirement, it can cost their employer more than $50,000 due to a combination of factors including higher relative salaries, higher health care costs, younger employee retention through promotion, and several other elements. For companies that may be less concerned with an aging employee population, forgoing matches can still contribute to rising retention and replacement costs due to the impact of financial distress on employee performance. In a survey by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), which measured the impact of personal financial stress on employee performance, 47% of HR professionals noticed that employees struggle with their “ability to focus on work.” Poor productivity not only costs the business in output, but can inevitably lead to higher employee turnover, which can lead to higher costs associated with retention and hiring. Make a smart compensation decision Are you debating between giving employees a raise and offering them a 401(k) plan contribution? Consider this example using $3,000. A $3,000 increase in base pay will mean a net increase to the employee of just $2,250, assuming 25% in income taxes and FICA combined. For the employer, that increase will cost $2,422.12, after FICA adjusted for a 25% in income tax rate. Employee Income After-Tax Employer Net Cost $3,000.00 Increased Pay $3,000.00 Increased Payroll ($750.00) Taxes @ 25% $229.50 FICA @ 7.65% &nbsp; &nbsp; ($807.38) Tax Deduction @ 25% $2,250.00 Net Paycheck $2,422.12 Net Cost Alternatively, a $3,000 contribution to an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan results in no FICA for either the employee or the employer.&nbsp; The employee would receive the full benefit of that $3,000 today on a pre-tax basis PLUS it would grow tax-free until retirement. As the employer, your tax deduction on that 401(k) contribution would be $750, meaning your cost is just $2,250 —or 7% less than if you had provided a $3,000 salary increase. Betterment can help boost tax savings even more... After you set up your 401(k) plan with Betterment, your employees can start investing for retirement and save on current taxes if they decide to save on a pre-tax basis. But Betterment provides additional tax saving strategies for those employees with two or more Betterment account types (including pre-tax 401(k) and Roth 401(k), but also a retail account) can have their investments optimized by using our Tax Coordination feature at no additional cost. This strategy generally places your least tax-efficient assets in your tax-advantaged accounts (like pre-tax 401(k)s), which already have big tax breaks, while diverting the most tax-efficient assets to your taxable accounts. …And help you take care of the paperwork You may be wondering: “Do I need to report 401(k) contributions?” The answer is “yes.” Specifically,&nbsp; employees’ contributions must be reported on their Form W2, Wage and Tax Statement, and Form W-3, Transmittal of Wage &amp; Tax Statement. In addition, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), you are required to fulfill specific 401(k) plan reporting requirements, which include detailing employer and employee 401(k) contributions.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Everything You Need to Know About 401(k) Blackout Periods  Maybe you’ve heard of a 401(k) blackout period, but if you don’t know exactly what it is or how to explain it to your employees, read on. You’ve probably heard of a 401(k) plan blackout period – but do you know what it is and how to explain it to your employees? Read on for answers to the most frequently asked questions about blackout periods. What is a blackout period? A blackout period is a time when participants are not able to access their 401(k) accounts because a major plan change is being made. During this time, they are not allowed to direct their investments, change their contribution rate or amount, make transfers, or take loans or distributions. However, plan assets remain invested during the blackout period. In addition, participants can continue to make contributions and loan repayments, which will continue to be invested according to the latest elections on file. Participants will be able to see these inflows and any earnings in their accounts once the blackout period has ended. When is a blackout period necessary? Typically, a blackout period is necessary when: 401(k) plan assets and records are being moved from one retirement plan provider to another &nbsp;New employees are added to a company’s plan during a merger or acquisition Available investment options are being modified Blackout periods are a normal and necessary part of 401(k) administration during such events to ensure that records and assets are accurately accounted for and reconciled. In these circumstances, participant accounts must be valued (and potentially liquidated) so that funds can be reinvested in new options. In the event of a plan provider change, the former provider must formally pass the data and assets to the new plan provider. Therefore, accounts must be frozen on a temporary basis before the transition. How long does a blackout period last? A blackout period usually lasts about 10 business days. However, it may need to be extended due to unforeseen circumstances, which are rare; but there is no legal maximum limit for a blackout period. Regardless, you must give advance notice to your employees that a blackout is on the horizon. What kind of notice do I have to give my employees about a blackout period? Is your blackout going to last for more than three days? If so, you’re required by federal law to send a written notice of the blackout period to all of your plan participants and beneficiaries. The notice must be sent at least 30 days – but no more than 60 days – prior to the start of the blackout. Typically, your plan provider will provide you with language so that you can send an appropriate blackout notice to your plan participants. If you are moving your plan from another provider to Betterment, we will coordinate with your previous recordkeeper to establish a timeline for the transfer, including the timing and expected duration of the blackout period. Betterment will draft a blackout notice on your behalf to provide to your employees, which will include the following: Reason for the blackout Identification of any investments subject to the blackout period Description of the rights otherwise available to participants and beneficiaries under the plan that will be temporarily suspended, limited, or restricted The expected beginning and ending date of the blackout A statement that participants should evaluate the appropriateness of their current investment decisions in light of their inability to direct or diversify assets during the blackout period If at least 30 days-notice cannot be given, an explanation of why advance notice could not be provided The name, address, and telephone number of the plan administrator or other individual who can answer questions about the blackout Who should receive the blackout notice? All plan participants with a balance should receive the blackout notice, regardless of their employment status with your company. In addition, we suggest sending the notice to eligible active employees, even if they currently don’t have a balance, since they may wish to start contributing and should be made aware of the upcoming blackout period. What should I say if my employees are concerned about an upcoming blackout period? Reassure your employees that a blackout period is normal and that it’s a necessary event that happens when significant plan changes are made. Also, encourage them to look at their accounts and make any changes they see fit prior to the start of the blackout period. Thinking about changing plan providers? If you’re thinking about changing plan providers, but are concerned about the ramifications of a blackout period, know that Betterment is here to help. Our team is here to guide you through the process, and we are committed to making the transition as seamless as possible for you and your participants.

    <p class="item-title">Understanding 401(k) Fees</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Understanding 401(k) Fees  Come retirement time, the number of 401(k) plan fees charged can make a major difference in your employees’ account balances—and their futures. Did&nbsp;you know that the smallest 401(k) plans often pay the most in fees? We believe that you don’t have to pay high fees to provide your employees with a top-notch 401(k) plan. In fact, Betterment offers comprehensive plan solutions at one of the lowest costs in the industry. Why do 401(k) fees matter? The difference between a 1% fee and a 2% fee may not sound like much, but in reality, higher 401(k) fees can take a major bite out of your participants’ retirement savings. Consider this example: Triplets Jane, Julie, and Janet each began investing in their employers’ 401(k) plan at the age of 25. Each had a starting salary of $50,000, increased by 3% annually, and contributed 6% of their pre-tax salary with no company matching contribution. Their investments returned 6% annually. The only difference is that their retirement accounts were charged annual 401(k) fees of 1%, 1.5%, and 2%, respectively. Forty years later, they’re all thinking about retiring and decide to compare their account balances. Here’s what they look like: &nbsp; Annual 401(k) fee Account balance at age 65 Jane 1% $577,697 Julie 1.5% $517,856 Janet 2% $465,894 Information is hypothetical and provided for educational purposes only. As such, these figures do not reflect Betterment’s management fee and do not reflect any actual client performance As you can see, come retirement time, the amount of fees charged can make a major difference in your employees’ account balances—and their futures. Why should employers care about 401(k) fees? You care about your employees, so naturally, you want to help them build brighter futures. But beyond that, it’s your fiduciary duty as a plan sponsor to make sure you’re only paying reasonable 401(k) fees for services that are necessary for your plan. The Department of Labor (DOL) outlines rules that you must follow to fulfill this fiduciary responsibility, including “ensuring that the services provided to the plan are necessary and that the cost of those services is reasonable” and has published a guide to assist you in this process. Generally, any firm providing services of $1,000 or more to your 401(k) plan is required to provide a fee disclosure, which is the first step in understanding your plan’s fees and expenses. It’s important to note that the regulations do not require you to ensure your fees are the lowest available, but that they are reasonable given the level and quality of service and support you and your employees receive. Benchmark the fees against similar retirement plans (by number of employees and plan assets, for example) to see if they’re reasonable.&nbsp; What are the main types of fees? Typically, 401(k) fees fall into three categories: administrative fees, individual service fees, and investment fees. Let’s dig a little deeper into each category: Plan administration fees—Paid to your 401(k) provider, plan administration fees typically cover 401(k) set-up fees, as well as general expenses such as recordkeeping, communications, support, legal, and trustee services. These costs are often assessed as a flat annual fee. Investment fees—Investment fees, typically assessed as a percentage of assets under management, may take two forms: fund fees that are expressed as an expense ratio or percentage of assets, and investment advisory fees for portfolio construction and the ongoing management of the plan assets. Betterment, for instance, acts as investment advisor to its 401(k) clients, assuming full fiduciary responsibility for the selection and monitoring of funds. And as is also the case with Betterment, the investment advisory fee may even include personalized investment advice for every employee. Individual service fees—If participants elect certain services—such as taking out a 401(k) loan—they may be assessed individual fees for each service. Wondering what you and your employees are paying in 401(k) fees? Fund fees are detailed in the funds’ prospectuses and are often wrapped up into one figure known as the expense ratio, expressed as a percentage of assets. Other fees are described in agreements with your service providers. High quality, low fees Typically, mutual funds have dominated the retirement investment landscape, but in recent years, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become increasingly popular. At Betterment, we believe that a portfolio of ETFs, in conjunction with personalized, unbiased advice, is the ideal solution for today’s retirement savers. Who pays 401(k) fees: the employer or the participant? The short answer is that it depends. As the employer, you may have options with respect to whether certain fees may be allocated to plan participants. Expenses incurred as a result of plan-related business expenses (so-called “ settlor expenses”) cannot be paid from plan assets. An example of such an expense would be a consulting fee related to the decision to offer a plan in the first place. Other costs associated with plan administration are eligible to be charged to plan assets. Of course, just because certain expenses can be paid by plan assets doesn’t mean you are off the hook in monitoring them and ensuring they remain reasonable. Plan administration fees are often paid by the employer. While it could be a significant financial responsibility for you as the business owner, there are three significant upsides: &nbsp; Reduced fiduciary liability—As you read, paying excessive fees is a major source of fiduciary liability. If you pay for the fees from a corporate account, you reduce potential liability. &nbsp; Lowered income taxes—If your company pays for the administration fees, they’re tax deductible! Plus, you can potentially save even more with the new SECURE Act tax credits for starting a new plan and for adding automatic enrollment. &nbsp; Increased 401(k) returns—Do you take part in your own 401(k) plan? If so, paying 401(k) fees from company assets means you’ll be keeping more of your personal retirement savings. Fund fees are tied to the individual investment options in each participant’s portfolio. Therefore, these fees are paid from each participant’s plan assets. Individual service fees are also paid directly by investors who elect the service, for example, taking a plan loan. How can you minimize your 401(k) fees? Minimizing your fees starts with the 401(k) provider you choose. In the past, the price for 401(k) plan administration was quite high. However, things have changed, and now the era of expensive, impersonal, unguided retirement saving is over. Innovative companies like Betterment now offer comprehensive plan solutions at a fraction of the cost of most providers. Betterment combines the power of efficient technology with personalized advice so that employers can provide a benefit that’s truly a benefit, and employees can know that they’re invested correctly for retirement. No hidden fees. Maximum transparency. Costs are often passed to the employee through fund fees, and in fact, mutual fund pricing structures incorporate non-investment fees that can be used to pay for other types of expenses. Because they are embedded in mutual fund expense ratios, they may not be explicit, therefore making it difficult for you to know exactly how much you and your employees are paying. In other words, most mutual funds in 401(k) plans contain hidden fees. At Betterment, we believe in transparency. Our use of ETFs means there are no hidden fees, so you and your employees are able to know how much you’re paying for the underlying investments themselves. Plus, our pricing structure unbundles the key offerings we provide—advisory, investment, record keeping, and compliance—and assigns a fee to each service. A clearly defined fee structure means no surprises for you—and more money working harder for your employees.

    <p class="item-title">ESG Investments in 401(k) Plans</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      ESG Investments in 401(k) Plans  The DOL proposal provides clarity with ESG investing. In the beginning of 2021, the Department of Labor (DOL) released a&nbsp; “final rule” entitled “Financial Factors in Selecting Plan Investments,” pertaining to ESG (environmental, social, governance) investments within a 401(k) plan. In March 2021, the DOL under the Biden administration stated that they were not going to enforce the previous administration’s rule until they had completed their own review. Most recently, the Biden DOL released its own proposal, reworking parts of the rule to be more favorable to the inclusion of ESG investments within 401(k)s and clarifying areas that had a chilling effect on fiduciaries performing their responsibilities. So what’s changed? &nbsp; 2020 Rule New Proposal Evaluating investments Investment choices must be based on “pecuniary” factors, which include time horizon, diversification, risk, and return. Clarifies that ESG factors are permissible and are financially material in the consideration of investments. Qualified default investment alternative (QDIA) Cannot select investment based on one or more non-pecuniary factors. ESG factors are permissible, allowing the possibility of wider adoption of ESG funds and portfolios. Tie-breaker test (when deciding between investments) Non-financial factors such as ESG are permissible. However, they must have detailed documentation. Permitted to select investments based on “collateral benefits” such as ESG. Where collateral benefits form the basis for investment choice, disclosure of collateral benefits required. Detailed tie-breaker documentation not required. Proxy voting Fiduciaries are not required to vote every proxy or exercise every shareholder right. Revised language stresses the importance of proxy voting in line with fiduciary obligations. Special monitoring for proxy voting when outsourcing responsibilities. Proxy voting activities must be recorded. Additional special monitoring is not required. Removal of record keeping of proxy activities. Safe harbors: a fiduciary can choose not to vote proxy if (a) the proposal is related to business activities or investment value (b) percentage ownership or the proposal being voted on is not significant enough to materially impact. Removal of safe harbors. Voting to further political or social causes “that have no connection to enhancing the economic value of the plan's investment” through proxy voting or shareholder activism is a violation. Opens the door to ESG factors when voting proxies as under the proposed rule that they are economically material. Why is this important? Under the proposal, the DOL clarifies that “climate change and other ESG factors can be financially material and when they are, considering them will inevitably lead to better long-term risk-adjusted returns, protecting the retirement savings of America’s workers.”&nbsp; Under the previous rule, many ESG factors would not count as a “pecuniary” factor. However, in actuality ESG factors have a high likelihood of impacting financial performance in the long run. For example, climate change can shift environmental conditions, force companies to transition and adapt to these shifts, lead to disruptions in business cycles and new innovations, and ultimately be a material financial risk over time when a company declines from failing to adapt. For retirement plans, the DOL’s revised proposal acknowledges that ESG risks could be&nbsp; important to consider when reviewing investments for strategic portfolio construction. Driving impact through ESG investing and proxy voting works. We’ve seen this concept in action with Engine No. 1 winning three ExxonMobil board seats in a six month long proxy battle. The change in having three new board members that are conscious of climate change and favor transitioning away from fossil fuels will benefit the company in the long term as renewable energy grows in prominence. After its successful proxy battle with Exxon, Engine No. 1 reported cordial discussions with representatives of Chevron Corp. regarding the company’s emissions reduction strategy, and also has reportedly built a stake in General Motors and expressed support for GM’s management actions relating to increased electric vehicle production and GM’s long-term strategy. Ernst &amp; Young also published data showing an increasing trend of how more Fortune 100 companies are incorporating ESG initiatives into proxy statements. For example, 91% disclosed they are incorporating workplace diversity into their initiatives in 2021 versus 61% in 2020.&nbsp; Demand for ESG products will continue We believe demand for ESG-focused investing will continue to grow, and it is important that regulations are clarified to accommodate this trend. Bloomberg projects that global assets in ESG will exceed $50 trillion by 2025, which is significant as it will represent a third of projected global assets under management. In the US, $17 trillion is invested in ESG assets. Trends within ESG ETFs tell the same story where fund flows this year have increased by more than 1000% compared to flows seen just three years ago. How Betterment incorporates ESG investing in 401(k) plans At Betterment, we believe investing through an ESG lens matters, and can be important to 401(k) participants investing on a longer time horizon. We’ve found many ways to thoughtfully weave ESG investing into our portfolio strategies. Betterment has a 10+ years track record of constructing globally diversified portfolios, along with a history of implementing ESG investment strategies in 401(k)s using our Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) portfolios. The SRI portfolios come with three different focuses: Broad Impact, Social Impact, and Climate Impact. Each of these portfolios allow our clients to choose how they want to invest to best align their portfolio with their values. Perceptions of higher fees in the ESG investment space has been a misconception that&nbsp; has historically posed an obstacle to the adoption of pro-ESG regulation. Expense ratios of ESG ETFs have declined to 0.20%, which is low compared to the 0.47% average expense ratio of all ETFs in the US. Within Betterment’s SRI portfolios, and depending on the investor’s overall portfolio allocation to stocks relative to bonds, the asset weighted expense ratios of the Broad Impact, Social, and Climate portfolios range from 0.12-0.18%, 0.13-0.20%, 0.13-0.20% respectively. Another misconception is that in order to adopt ESG investing, you have to sacrifice performance goals. As a 3(38) investment fiduciary, Betterment reviews fund selection on an ongoing basis to ensure we’ve performed our due diligence in selecting investments suitable for participants' desired investing objectives. To determine if there were in fact any financial tradeoffs associated with an SRI portfolio strategy relative to the Betterment Core, we examined evidence based on historical returns. When adjusting for the stock allocation level and Betterment fees, we found that: There were no material performance differences. The portfolios were highly correlated overall. In certain time periods the SRI portfolios outperformed the Betterment Core portfolio. Another example of how we’ve incorporated ESG impact investing is through the addition of the Engine No. 1 Transform 500 ETF (VOTE) into all three of our SRI portfolio strategies in 2021. With VOTE ETF, you can still maintain exposure to the 500 largest companies within the US at an inexpensive expense ratio of 0.05%. That may seem counterintuitive since it mirrors owning the S&amp;P 500 Index, however the magic happens behind the scenes as the fund manager uses share ownership to vote proxies in favor of ESG initiatives. This is a new form of shareholder activism and another way performance goals, exposure, and fees do not have to be sacrificed to make a difference.&nbsp; What’s next? We are hopeful that ease of interpretation with this rule may allow wider adoption of ESG products as investment options and may lead to greater incorporation of ESG factors in the decision making process as we do believe they are material. This has been a focus of Betterment’s as we seek to remain ahead of the trend with our product solutions.&nbsp; We will continue to monitor ongoing developments and keep you informed. Note: Higher bond allocations in your portfolio decrease the percentage attributable to socially responsible ETFs.

    <p class="item-title">How Does a Multiple Employer Plan Compare to a Single Employer 401(k) Plan?</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      How Does a Multiple Employer Plan Compare to a Single Employer 401(k) Plan?  Are MEPs and PEPs the new solution for workplace retirement savings or should I pick my own 401(k) plan? Multiple employer plans (MEPs) have been around for many years, but the rules governing these types of retirement plans limit their availability to many employers. In an effort to help more small and mid-sized companies offer retirement savings plans to their employees, the SECURE Act ushered in new changes so that, beginning in 2021, any business can join a new type of MEP, called a Pooled Employer Plan (PEP). Because of this new development, MEPs and PEPs have become buzzwords in the industry and no doubt you’ll see advertisements touting the benefits of these one-size-fits-all type plans. But are they really the magic bullet policymakers are hoping will solve the “retirement savings crisis”? That remains to be determined, but for many employers, sponsoring their own 401(k) plan with the right plan provider is the best way to ensure their goals for a retirement savings plan are met. What is a MEP? A multiple employer plan or MEP is a retirement plan, often structured as a 401(k) plan, that is established and administered by an “MEP organizer.” The MEP organizer makes the plan available to many different employers. If the MEP meets certain requirements set forth in the tax laws and ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act), it will be treated as a single plan managed by the organizer and not as a series of separate plans administered by each participating employer. The MEP organizer serves as plan fiduciary and typically assumes both administrative and investment management responsibilities for all employers participating in the MEP. An MEP is viewed by the Department of Labor (DOL) as a single plan eligible to file one Form 5500 only if the employers participating in the MEP are part of the same trade or association or are located in the same geographical area. There must be some commonality between the participating employers besides just participating in the MEP. A Professional Employer Organization (PEO) may also sponsor an MEP for its employer clients. What is a PEP? The rules limiting the benefits of an MEP to employers with commonality limited the usefulness of MEPs for many small businesses. To allow broader participation in MEPs, the SECURE Act added a new type of MEP, called a Pooled Employer Plan or PEP, effective for plan years beginning in 2021. A PEP is a 401(k) plan that will operate much like a MEP with a plan organizer and multiple participating employers, but there are a few important differences. Any employer can join a PEP; the businesses do not have to have any common link for the PEP to be considered a single plan. But the PEP must be sponsored by a “Pooled Plan Provider” (PPP) that has registered with the DOL and IRS. The Pooled Plan Provider must be designated in the PEP plan document as the named fiduciary and the ERISA 3(16) plan administrator. This service provider is also responsible for ensuring the PEP meets the requirements of ERISA and the tax code, including ensuring participant disclosures are provided and nondiscrimination testing is performed. The PPP must also obtain a fidelity bond and ensure that any other entities acting as fiduciary to the PEP are bonded. What are the benefits of participating in a MEP or PEP? Small businesses may refrain from adopting a retirement plan for their employees because of the administrative burdens, fiduciary liability, and cost associated with workplace plans. MEPs have been identified in recent years as a way to address these concerns for employers and potentially increase access to workplace retirement plans for employees of small and mid-size businesses. The MEP structure can alleviate much of the administrative and fiduciary burdens for participating employers, and potentially reduce costs. Reduced fiduciary responsibility – The MEP organizer or the PPP takes on fiduciary responsibility for managing the plan and for selecting and monitoring service providers. This generally includes selecting investments that will be offered in the plan. Reduced administrative responsibility – The MEP organizer or the PPP is responsible for day-to-day administration and complying with all applicable rules and regulations for plan operations. Investment pricing – A MEP/PEP arrangement pools plan assets of all participating employers, which may allow the MEP/PEP to obtain better pricing on investments. Reduced plan expenses – MEPs/PEPs allow small businesses to benefit from economies of scale by sharing the expenses for plan documents, general plan administration, and one Form 5500. Because of these benefits, interest in MEPs has grown over the years, leading to the rule changes that open the MEP opportunity to all employers through a PEP. How do MEPs &amp; PEPs Differ from a Single 401(k) Plan? Many of the responsibilities associated with managing a retirement plan that can challenge plan sponsors are taken on by the MEP organizer or the PPP. This third party is responsible for making almost all the decisions related to managing the plan, hiring and monitoring service providers, and overseeing the plan’s investments and operations. The MEP/PEP entity must perform these services on behalf of all participating employers and will be held to the high fiduciary standards of ERISA for these duties. Once the employer has prudently selected the MEP/PEP entity, the employer is relieved of the day-to-day operational oversight and investment management. However, this transfer of responsibilities also means a transfer of control over key decisions regarding the plan. Conversely, when an employer establishes its own 401(k) plan for its employees, the employer retains many of these operational and investment responsibilities, which the employer typically fulfills with the support of service providers. The employer can design the plan based solely on their goals and objectives for the plan and their employees’ needs. The flexibility retained by an employer adopting a single 401(k) plan includes: Selecting the plan design features that fit their employees’ needs Picking the service provider that will assist them in operating the plan and provide relevant education and guidance to their employees Choosing the menu of investments that will be offered to participants in the plan or engaging an investment advisor to manage or guide investment selection Deciding whether to offer personalized advice to employees When Might a Single 401(k) Plan Might Be Better? While the shared expenses and reduced responsibilities of participating in a MEP/PEP can be attractive to small and midsize employers, sometimes what one employer sees as a benefit, another employer sees as a disadvantage. For example, because the MEP/PEP entity is operating one plan for many employers, the plan may be designed with the features that will be most widely accepted by most employers. There is typically little customization available in order to keep plan operations efficient (and cost effective) for the MEP/PEP entity. Participating employers generally have no control over service providers, plan design, or the participant experience. Additionally, although the structure of a MEP/PEP is meant to reduce administrative and investment expenses for participating employers, it remains to be seen if the cost of these plans will be competitive with the low-cost 401(k) plans available today without compromising on the quality and breadth of services. PEPs will open up the multiple employer plan market to all employers for the first time ever. And there are many financial organizations and service providers preparing to capitalize on this new solution by launching PEP products. Although the DOL has provided some guidance, the industry is still awaiting additional guidance on&nbsp;a number of critical elements necessary for building the PEP plan product, including plan documents, acceptable compensation arrangements for service and investment providers, administrative responsibilities for PPPs, and special Form 5500 rules. With so many unknowns yet in the PEP market, it’s difficult to predict whether this new type of multiple employer plan will hit the mark for small business owners. Employers can benefit from the simplicity of a single service provider solution and receive professional fiduciary and administrative support right now with a 401(k) solution designed specifically for small and midsized plans.

    <p class="item-title">The Importance and Benefits of Offering Employer Match</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      The Importance and Benefits of Offering Employer Match  Some employees resist saving because they feel retirement is too far away, can’t afford it, or can’t grasp the benefit. You can help change that mentality by offering a 401(k) employer match. Beyond being an attractive employee benefit, a 401(k) plan can act as a catalyst for employees at all career stages to save for retirement. Some employees, however, will resist saving because they feel retirement is too far away, or can’t afford it, or can’t make room in their budget (and current spending levels). However, as a 401(k) plan sponsor, you can help change that mentality by offering a 401(k) employer matching contribution. What is a 401(k) employer matching contribution? With an employer match, a portion or all of an employee’s 401(k) plan contribution will be “matched” by the employer. Common matching formulas include: Dollar-for-Dollar Match: Carla works for ABC Company, which runs payroll on a semi-monthly basis (two times a month = 24 pay periods a year). Her gross pay every period is $2,000. She has decided to defer 4% of her pre-tax pay every pay period, or $80 (4% x $2,000). The ABC Company 401(k) plan generously offers a dollar-for-dollar match up to 4% of compensation deferred. With each payroll, $80 of Carla’s pay goes to her 401(k) account on a pre-tax basis, and ABC Company also makes an $80 matching contribution to Carla’s 401(k) account. At a 4% contribution rate, Carla is maximizing the employer contribution amount. If she reduces her contribution to 3%, her company matching contribution would also drop to 3%; but if she increases her contribution to 6%, the formula dictates that her employer would only contribute 4%. Partial Match (simple): Let’s take the same scenario as above, but ABC Company 401(k) plan matches 50% on the first 6% of compensation deferred. This means that it will match half of the 401(k) contributions. If Carla contributes $80 to the 401(k) plan, ABC Company will contribute $40 on top of her contribution as the match. Tiered Match: By applying different percentages to multiple tiers, employers can encourage employees to contribute to the plan while controlling their costs. For example, ABC Company could match 100% of deferrals up to 3% of compensation and 50% on the next 3% of deferrals. Carla contributes 4% of her pay of $2,000, which is $80 per pay period. Based on their formula, ABC Company will match her dollar-for-dollar on 3% of her contribution ($60 = 3% x $2,000), and 50 cents on the dollar on the last 1% of her contribution for a total matching contribution of $70 or 3.5%. The plan’s matching formula is chosen by the company and specified in the plan document or may be defined as discretionary, in which case the employer may determine not only whether or not to make a matching contribution in any given year, but also what formula to use. Is there a limit to how much an employer can match? The IRS limits annual 401(k) contributions, and these limits change from year to year. It’s also important to note that the IRS caps annual compensation that’s eligible to be matched. Potential Benefits of Providing an Employer Match Attract talent: Offering a 401(k) is a great way to set your company apart from the competition, and a matching contribution sweetens the deal! A Betterment at Work study found that 68 percent of respondents would prioritize having better financial wellness benefits above an extra week of vacation! Better 401(k) plan participation: Unlike other types of employer contributions, a matching contribution requires employees to contribute their own money to the plan. In other words, the existence of the match drives plan participation up (not contributing is like leaving money on the table), encouraging employee engagement and increasing the likelihood of having your plan pass certain compliance tests. Financial well-being of employees: A matching contribution shows employees that you care about their financial well-being and are willing to make an investment in their future. The additional funds can help employees reach their retirement savings goal. Improved retention: The match is essentially “free money” that can be considered part of an employee’s compensation, which can be hard to give up. And by applying a vesting schedule to the employer match, you can incentivize employees to stay longer with your company to gain the full benefits of the 401(k) plan. Employer tax deduction: matching contributions are tax deductible, which means you can &nbsp; deduct them from your company’s income so long as they don’t exceed IRS limits.&nbsp; Offering a 401(k) plan is already a huge step forward in helping your employees save for their retirement. Providing a 401(k) matching contribution enhances that benefit for both your employees and your organization. Ready for a better 401(k) solution?

    <p class="item-title">Betterment’s 401(k) Investment Approach</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Betterment’s 401(k) Investment Approach  Helping employees make better decisions and providing choice to those who want it. Dan Egan, Betterment’s VP of Behavioral Finance and Investing, explains why Betterment’s investment approach is effective for all 401(k) participants&nbsp; Investment Approach Q&amp;A Betterment’s 401(k) investment approach differs from that of traditional providers, but can you give us a little history about the 401(k) environment pre-Betterment? If I go back to the first job where I had a 401(k) probably about 20 years ago, there was a lineup of funds, and it was up to me as a 401(k) participant&nbsp; to figure out which funds to pick and in what ratios, how much to save and so on. The research coming from that period showed that people often ended up in an analysis paralysis state, where there was so much choice and so many things to consider. It was very difficult for people to know whether they were investing at the appropriate risk level, how much they were paying and so on. Many people were so overloaded that they decided to forego saving for retirement rather than risk making a “bad” decision. But as the industry matured, and everyone realized that more choice does not necessarily lead to better decision-making, the Pension Protection Act (PPA) was passed in 2006. The idea here was not to eliminate choice, but to encourage good defaults that would encourage 401(k) plan participation. How exactly did the PPA encourage more 401(k) participation? For one thing, it allowed for safe harbor investments in the form of QDIAs, or qualified default investment alternatives. The most popular QDIAs were target date funds, which are linked to an individual’s age so if you're 40, it’s assumed that you will be investing for the next 25 years and retiring at 65. Target dates have a glidepath so that the stock allocation becomes more conservative over time, so the employee doesn't have to do anything like managing a portfolio or rebalancing. After the PPA, it became much more common for employees to be auto-enrolled using a target date fund or something like it, and all of sudden, they no longer had to make choices. People were no longer worried about picking and choosing from a whole bunch of individual funds or even individual stocks. And the plan designs promoted by the PPA really worked: plan participation rates that had been languishing saw rates increase to more than 90% after implementing auto-enrollment.&nbsp; By the time Betterment started its 401(k) platform, the changes brought about by the PPA were already well established. So talk a little bit now about how Betterment's 401(k) investment approach differs from that of traditional 401(k) providers. Betterment takes and builds upon a lot of the ideas in a target date fund and goes further. Number one, we are not a fund provider. We are independent from fund companies. So part of our job as a 3(38) investment fiduciary is to be an investment advisor and financial advisor, and do the due diligence on all of the funds that we make available. If you're picking from amongst eight large-cap US stock funds, there's not a lot of variation in what their returns are going to look like and you can generally predict performance versus a benchmark knowing the fund costs. So part of our job is to actually do the work on the behalf of participants, to narrow down the field of funds towards just the ones that stand out within a given asset class and that are cost-effective. We then ask more specific questions including not just how old someone is, but also more personalized questions like when someone plans on retiring. Some people want to retire as early as possible. That might be 55, 57, 62 (which is the earliest possible age you can start collecting Social Security). Other people want to keep working as late as possible, which is 70 or 72. Those are extremely different retirement plans that should have different portfolios based upon those hugely different time horizons. So unlike a target date fund, which says, this is your age and you're done, Betterment is going to ask about your age, but also things like, when do you want to retire? Putting together a retirement plan might also involve your spouse or significant others, retirement assets, and even doing tax optimization across the account types that you have available to you. And how does that help the employee? A lot of it is about making it easy for consumers to make better decisions, not imposing a bunch of choices on them. You have to remember, the vast majority of people are not frequently thinking about stocks and investing. They don't want to have to look up prospectuses and put together a risk managed portfolio. So Betterment does the work for them to make it easy for them to understand how to get to where they want to be. I want to be clear that that's not necessarily about removing choice, it's about making it easy to get to a solution quickly. It’s also about minimizing the number of unnecessary choices for most people while maintaining choice for people who want it. At Betterment, 401(k) investors can still modify your risk level. You can say, "Yeah, maybe it makes sense for me to be at 90% stocks, but I'm not comfortable with it. I want to be at 30% stocks." Or they can modify their allocations using our flexible portfolio strategy, so that they can come in and say, "Actually I don't like international [investments] as much." So it's not about removing choice. And we let them see the consequences of that in terms of risk and return. So employees in Betterment 401(k)s have choice, but how do you respond to people who might already have a 401(k) or are already invested in funds outside of their 401(k), and have a favorite fund that they feel is an absolute must have? I’m not necessarily against people who have put time and effort into researching something and wanting to invest in it. But I think it is focusing on the wrong thing. When you look at long-run research statistics on funds, the predictability of fund success within a category is low. A fund that outperformed last quarter is unlikely to continue to outperform this quarter. So I would say that the fund is very rarely the most important aspect of the 401(k) plan or decision. And I’d guess most participants don't have a favorite fund. Again, going back to research we've looked at across a wide array of companies, most people are looking to minimize how much burden is imposed upon them in making decisions about what they should do for their retirement. There is generally a very small minority who have very strong views about what the right investments are. And that trade-off shows up in that we will generally look at low-cost funds, well-diversified funds. We do offer a range of choice in terms of portfolio strategy: do you want a factor-tilted portfolio or a socially-responsible portfolio or an income portfolio? Without necessarily saying that you're responsible for doing the fund due diligence yourself. It is true that we offer a trade-off: we're not the wild west where you can go out and get anything you want. And that is because that level of discretion is rarely used by plan participants. There's a lot of potential to do the wrong thing when somebody has a completely open access plan. Not to mention, all plan fiduciaries have an obligation to act in the best interests of their plan participants as a whole. So they have to evaluate what makes the most sense for the majority of plan participants, not a small, vocal minority. Somewhat related, what is your response to people who argue that Betterment’s all-ETF fund line-up is too limited? A 401(k) plan made up exclusively of ETFs is no less limiting than a 401(k) plan made up exclusively of mutual funds. Because mutual funds have been around much longer, it’s true that their universe is larger, but I think anyone would be hard pressed to argue that our expert-built and third-party portfolios are not enough to choose from. ETFs are critical to Betterment’s investment approach and a better alternative for 401(k) plans, in large part because mutual funds have complex fee structures and are typically more expensive than ETFs which have transparent and low costs. So why do so many plans still use mutual funds? We believe it’s not despite these issues but because of them, since fees embedded in mutual fund expense ratios are often used to offset the costs of 401(k) vendors servicing the plan. In addition, many legacy recordkeeping systems do not have the technology to handle ETF intraday trading and must restrict their clients to using funds that are only valued at the end of the day. Betterment’s 401(k) plan comes with a 0.25% investment advisory fee. What do employers and employees get for that? I think there's actually two levels to this. The first is “does this actually cost me more?” It’s definitely more transparent in its cost, but most 401(k) plans charge more via higher fund fees. The fund fees may even include embedded fees that go to pay for other plan services. In these more traditional models, the fees are hidden from you, the consumer. But trust me: everybody is getting paid. It's just a matter of whether or not you're aware how much and who you're paying. That also sets up the very important second aspect which is: what is this investment manager responsible for and what are they incentivized to do well? What does Betterment do for 25 basis points? Well, number one, that's how we make sure that we're independent from the fund companies; we don’t get paid by them. Every quarter, we go out and we look at all of the funds that are available in the market. We review them, independent of who provides them, looking at cost, liquidity, tax burdens, and more. And if we find a better fund, because we take no money from fund companies, we're going to move to that better fund. So one thing that you're paying for is, in effect, not only ongoing due diligence and checking, but you're paying for independence, which means that you know we’re unbiased when changes are made inside of your portfolio. The other thing you get is that we want to earn that 25 basis points by serving clients better. So we want to invest in things like personalized retirement portfolios (available to every 401(k) participant) where we are actually able to give better retirement advice that takes into account you, your partner, all the various kinds of retirement accounts you have: Roth, IRA, taxable, trust, and more. Or asset location, for example, which works across tax-advantaged retirement accounts so that employees can keep more of their money and enjoy higher levels of spending in retirement. Employees with a Betterment 401(k) can learn more about our investment options here; plan sponsors can explore them here.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Welcome to Betterment 401(k)!  Find out how to make the most of your plan and get your employees to start saving for their future. We’re excited that you have chosen to help your employees prioritize your financial wellness with us, starting with your 401(k) plan. Betterment’s easy-to-use platform is designed to help you feel confident in administering your plan. Let’s get started. TABLE OF CONTENTS Overview Administration and compliance Investments Employee experience Overseeing your plan (including our 401(k) glossary) Betterment contact information Plan Sponsor dashboard overview Special note for first-time plans Adding new participants (individually and in bulk) Adding multiple employees at once Updating employee information Remitting contributions to Betterment Updating employee contribution (deferral) rate changes Distribution and loan requests Approving distributions Approving loans Reports Important documents Overview By sponsoring a 401(k) plan, you take on important fiduciary responsibilities for the plan, including acting in the best interests of plan participants at all times, following the plan document as written, paying only reasonable fees, depositing contributions in a timely manner and meeting all reporting and disclosure requirements. While you can never fully transfer or eliminate all fiduciary responsibility, Betterment will help with many of these duties. In fact, at no extra cost to you or your employees, Betterment assumes certain fiduciary functions to reduce your liability, serving as both a 3(16) administrative fiduciary and a 3(38) investment fiduciary. Let’s review key areas of your plan and the support that Betterment provides. As always, we provide support via phone and email to both you and your employees. Administration and compliance Our innovative technology and dedicated support make it easy for you to keep your plan running smoothly and remain fully compliant at all times. As your 3(16) fiduciary, we perform a wide range of administrative duties including preparing and filing your Form 5500 As your 3(38) investment manager with full discretion, we will select and monitor plan investments We provide on-going consultative support with respect to plan design, compliance testing and annual audits Investments Betterment uses low-cost ETFs to create globally diversified portfolios across 12 asset classes that are designed to help maximize returns for each level of risk. Employees will be defaulted into a portfolio that corresponds to their years to retirement, but they choose alternative investment strategies if they wish: Flexible Portfolio -- using funds in Betterment Core Portfolio Strategy, employees can customize their portfolio by adjusting fund weights Socially Responsible Portfolio -- for socially-conscious employees who want their investments to reflect their personal values Goldman Sachs Smart Beta Portfolio -- for employees who are willing to take on additional risks in the pursuit of higher returns BlackRock Target Income Portfolio -- for retirees (or employees with non-retirement goals), this approach seeks to provide a steady stream of cash income In addition, our investment approach incorporates sophisticated strategies such as automatic rebalancing, tax coordination, and automatic allocation adjustments as someone gets older. And with personalized advice and an integrated platform, employees can earn better returns at various levels of risk. Employee experience Betterment’s clean design and straightforward tools help your employees get more out of their retirement plan. Our goals-based approach helps employees see all of their financial goals in one place. We help employees establish a Personal Retirement Plan based on their unique situation and preferences. Every time they log in, they can easily see whether they are off-track and take immediate corrective action. We make it easy for employees to sync other accounts so that our advice will propose a total solution that takes everything into consideration. Employees have access to numerous educational resources including: Comprehensive guide to your Betterment 401(k)&nbsp; Webinars and videos Website resources Articles FAQs Tools and calculators In addition, feel free to share the following to promote plan engagement and in response to specific employee questions: One-pagers Why save with a 401(k)? Small increases can make a big difference Employee guides 401(k) Rollovers&nbsp; What to do with your 401(k) account when you leave the company Overseeing your plan In addition to the fiduciary responsibilities mentioned above, plan oversight includes making sure you and those responsible for the plan’s operations are familiar with the plan document. Depending on the size of your organization, it may be appropriate to establish a 401(k) committee that meets periodically to review the plan. Decisions should be fully vetted and documented. On an on-going basis, you and members of your team will also be responsible for: Adding newly eligible employees to the plan Ensuring that Betterment has current and accurate employee information Review and approval of distributions (and loans, if offered by the plan) Sending contributions and contribution rate changes to Betterment (non-integrated plans only Monitoring any vendors you hire You will find more details in the day-to-day operations section below, including the differences between integrated and non-integrated plans. 401(k) glossary of terms Betterment contact information: For employers For employees Monday - Friday 9:00am - 6:00pm EST 1-855-906-5280 plansupport@bettermentforbusiness.com Monday - Friday 9:00am - 6:00pm EST 1-855-906-5281 support@betterment.com Plan sponsor dashboard overview The plan sponsor dashboard is the home for your 401(k) plan, where you can perform all administrative functions and find all plan information. To get started, visit the plan sponsor login page, which is not to be confused with the login page to your personal Betterment account. (Although you may have the same login credentials for both pages, they are two different websites with different login specifications.) The plan sponsor dashboard allows for three levels of access: Administrator access provides full access to the dashboard and allows all actions to be performed. Staff access provides the same access as an administrator but does not allow plan managers to be added or deleted. View only access does not allow items on the dashboard to be edited. In order to gain access to the plan sponsor dashboard, you must either be invited by a member of your Betterment Plan Support Team or a current plan manager who has Administrator access (via Settings&gt;Manage access). The plan sponsor dashboard contains several tabs that you should familiarize yourself with.&nbsp; We will be referencing these tabs throughout this document. Home -- shows you high-level statistics and summary information about your plan, along with notifications that may require your attention and and recent plan activity Employees -- lists all active and inactive employees in your plan, along with information that requires your review Payroll -- location to upload payroll. Also includes notifications and past payroll activity Plan -- in addition to plan statistics, this is where you will go to approve loan and distribution requests. You will also be able to view recent activity as well as upcoming compliance deadlines Resources - source for reports, documents and education information to support you in your role as plan administrator. Under the Documents tab, you will find templates you may need for various uploads; and under the Support tab, you will find FAQs. Special note for first-time plans As a new plan, there are two small but important items to set up your 401(k) plan correctly and avoid complications down the road: Ensure payroll system and Betterment match Before your payroll launch date, make sure that your payroll system is set up to correctly withhold employee contributions. Your Betterment 401(k) offers Traditional and Roth contributions. Typically, these are two separate deduction codes within payroll systems. Make sure that your employee contribution elections from Betterment match your payroll system. You will receive notifications in your plan sponsor dashboard of changes and you can also run a custom report. Definition of compensation Our plan documents usually define compensation as all earned income (think Box 5 of the W2). That means all income reported on the W2 must be included in the calculation of deductions within the payroll system. You want to ensure that your payroll system includes commission and bonus checks as compensation for purposes of 401(k) deductions. Loan Code If your plan offers loans, you will need to set up a loan deduction code in your payroll system so that the loan repayment amount will be deducted from the participant’s paycheck on the first repayment date. Adding new participants (individually and in bulk) If your plan is integrated with one of our preferred payroll providers, new participants are added automatically when created in the payroll system, so this operation does not apply to you. When an employee becomes eligible for the plan, they must be added to the Betterment system. You can add each employee individually through the plan sponsor dashboard using these steps (our bulk upload process is outlined further down): To add a new participant, login to the plan sponsor dashboard. Once in the dashboard, click on the Employees tab, then click on the blue Add Employee button Follow the prompts on each page to successfully add a new employee. You will receive an error message if any data is incomplete or appears incorrect. Uploading multiple employees at once To make it easier and save time, you may want to take advantage of our bulk employee upload process which is detailed in this in-depth tutorial. We have built in a 15-minute buffer between the time you submit employee information to us and the time an employee sees a Betterment 401(k) welcome email. This allows you to correct any mistakes that you might realize right after you hit submit! Clients often ask: What are some common errors when adding a new employee? Answer: Two common errors we see during the “add a new employee” process include: Mismatched information to existing Betterment customer record If someone has previously had a Betterment account before joining your organization, all of the personal information must match the information we have on file. Differences may occur if, for example, the employee may have had a different last name when they signed up for Betterment years ago or their current profile includes a typo. The error “Last name matches existing user” indicates that the employee’s Betterment profile has a different last name. Failed ID check As part of SEC regulations and the US Patriot Act, Betterment must attempt to verify the identity of all our clients. Our system automatically checks new employee information you enter against a database of publicly-available information. Participants who fail the ID check will be alerted via email and should follow the prompts in the email to resolve the issue. It is not uncommon for newly married, recently-relocated or younger participants to fail the ID checks, which is not a cause for concern. Updating employee information It is important that all employee information be kept current on the Betterment system. If your plan is integrated with one of our preferred payroll providers, please make sure all demographic data is correct in your payroll system, as that is the main source of truth and all demographic data on the Betterment system will be overwritten when the next sync with your plan occurs. For plans that do not have payroll integration: Participants can update every piece of personal information themselves within their profile under Settings. Plan administrators can update most employee information, with the exception of the email address linked to a participant account which serves as a login ID. If an email address was changed without an employee’s knowledge, they will be locked out of their account. Please contact the Betterment Plan Support Team for help in changing an email address or direct the employee to make the change themselves. Remitting contributions to Betterment If your plan is integrated with one of our preferred payroll partners, the process to remit contributions to your 401(k) plan couldn’t be easier. All you have to do is ensure the contribution data is accurate and run your payroll as you normally would! Once you run your payroll in your system: the contribution data will be automatically sent to Betterment for processing Betterment will send an ACH request to your bank account on file Upon receipt, Betterment will allocate the funds to the proper accounts and execute any necessary trades. For plans without integrated payroll, data must be uploaded via the Payroll Upload template accessible via the Payroll Upload page of the Plan Sponsor Dashboard. The pre-formatted template includes all of your employees who have an account in your 401(k) plan and can be populated with a report available on most payroll systems. Information required: compensation for the pay period hours worked for the pay period contribution amounts any applicable employer match amounts any applicable loan repayment amounts Once you have the file ready for upload: Login to the Plan Sponsor Dashboard and navigate to the Payroll Upload Page Click Upload Payroll NOTE: You will always get an email confirmation for the payroll upload. If you do not receive that email, your payroll submission was not completed. Upon receipt, Betterment will check for any issues and will send you an email with a summary of the contribution file, along with the amount to be withdrawn from your organization’s bank account. Once you approve the submission, we will send an ACH request to your bank account on file and upon receipt, allocate the funds to the proper accounts and execute any necessary trades. Updating employee contribution (deferral) rate changes If your plan is integrated with one of our preferred payroll providers, Betterment pushes all contribution rate changes directly to your payroll provider, meaning there is nothing for you to do! For plans that do not have payroll integration, some work is needed to make sure contribution rates are correctly passed to Betterment as recordkeeper and to ensure a clean audit trail. There are three ways for you to see contribution rate changes made by employees: View all recent changes by logging into the plan sponsor dashboard and clicking on Payroll&gt;Notifications. View the Weekly Deferral Rate Change email sent by Betterment, which links directly to the reports found on the dashboard. Run a Current Deferral Rate report by logging into the plan sponsor dashboard and&nbsp; navigating to Documents&gt;Reports&gt;Run a Report&gt;Current Deferral Rates. Regardless of which method you use, if any employees have made contribution rate changes, you will need to reflect those changes in your payroll system before you run your next payroll. Clients often ask: Are there regulatory requirements around how quickly I need to make contribution rate changes once I am alerted? Answer: The requirement is “as soon as administratively feasible,” which usually means within 1 to 2 pay periods. It’s very possible for you to miss a contribution rate change that an employee makes shortly before you run payroll. As long as you update your payroll system next time, you are fine. Distribution and loan requests As plan administrator, you are responsible for approving all loans and distributions since assets are leaving the plan. Approving distributions When a participant seeks a distribution online, our system will dynamically present them with available options at that moment in time (based on plan rules and the individual eligibility), with brief explanations regarding the pros and cons of taking a distribution. Once the participant submits a request, you will be alerted via email that a distribution request is pending. You can view any pending distribution request in the dashboard under Plan&gt;Distribution Requests. We suggest you check the distribution request for: Common or obvious spelling mistakes Accuracy of vesting Accuracy of matching contribution amounts if your plan provides a match Please note: Mistakes are easier to fix before the request is approved. Approving loans For the participant, the online loan request flow works similarly as for distributions. Once you receive an email that a loan request is pending, you will need to do the following: Approve the loan Add the loan repayment to your payroll system (regardless of whether your payroll is integrated). Reports You can find a variety of reports within the Plan Sponsor Dashboard to help you analyze, manage, monitor, and evaluate your plan. To run a report, simply go to Resources&gt;Reports&gt; Run a Report. Important documents Many of the important documents related to your plan can be found within Resources&gt;Documents, including participant notices and disclosures (participants may also find this information within their account via disclosures. These disclosures can be found in the plan sponsor dashboard via Documents&gt;401(k) Documents.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Betterment 401(k) – Bulk Upload Tutorial for Plan Sponsors  Betterment’s bulk upload tool allows you to add multiple employees to your plan quickly. This tutorial outlines best practices and shares helpful tips for using our bulk upload tool effectively. Step-by-step Tutorial Log in to the employee Dashboard &nbsp; Navigate to: employees → add employees → add multiple employees &nbsp; Download the CSV template &nbsp; Open the CSV template using a program like Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, or Google Sheets &nbsp; Fill out one row for each employee you want to upload. &nbsp; Use the table below to understand the columns in the template: Column Description First Name The employee’s legal first name No special characters accepted Last Name The employee’s legal last name No special characters accepted Middle Initial Leave blank if the employee doesn’t have a legal middle name Social Security Number The employee’s government-issued Social Security Number If the employee is not a US Citizen, a Social Security Number still needs to be provided Social Security Numbers should be formatted as 123-45-6789 Email Betterment uses email to complete the employee sign-up process and to send employees important plan notifications and updates Date of Birth Date should be formatted as MM/DD/YYYY Employment Status This field accepts the following inputs: active &nbsp; (currently employed) terminated &nbsp; (formerly employed) deceased &nbsp; (deceased) disabled &nbsp; (on disability leave) unpaid_leave &nbsp; (unpaid leave) retired &nbsp; (retired former employee) Date of Hire Date of hire can be up to one year in the future Date should be formatted as MM/DD/YYYY Date of Termination This field is required if Employment Status is terminated, deceased, disabled or retired This field can be left blank for employees who are active or who are on unpaid leave Date of termination can be up to one year in the future Date should be formatted as MM/DD/YYYY Date of Rehire This field is required if Employment Status is active and Date of Termination is set Address Line 1 This field is required for all employees The employee’s residential address cannot be a PO Box If the employee’s address includes a comma, you must put that address within quotation marks Address Line 2 This field can be left blank if the employee’s residential address is only one line City Part of the employee’s residential address State Part of the employee’s residential address State should be written using the official two-letter postal abbreviation Examples: NY, FL, CA, TX 5 Digit ZIP Code Part of the employee’s residential address Eligible This field accepts an input of Y or N If an employee will be hired in the future, you must enter N for Eligible, and enter a date in the Entry on column. This indicates that the employee will become eligible for the plan on the future date you’ve specified. Entry on This field defines the date on which an employee will become eligible for the 401(k) plan This date can be in the past or the future Date should be formatted as MM/DD/YYYY Electronic Access This field accepts an input of Y or N Can this employee receive emails and access Betterment’s website at a computer they use regularly as part of their job? Union Member This field accepts an input of Y or N Is this employee a member of a union? Date Joined Union Required if the employee is a member of a union Date should be formatted as MM/DD/YYYY Can be left blank for non-union employees Participant Type This field accepts the following inputs: primary &nbsp; (all participants who are currently in the plan, whether active, terminated, deceased, disabled, retired, or on leave) beneficiary &nbsp; (beneficiary of a deceased participant) alternate_payee &nbsp; (a person who will be the payee of a divorce or other legal settlement) Deferral Rate If an employee was participating in a 401(k) plan you had with a previous provider, please indicate their contribution rate from that provider. This will be used as their new default rate at Betterment. The employee will be able to log into their account to change this prior to their first contribution with Betterment. Traditional deferral amount and percent cannot both be present. Roth deferral amount and percent cannot both be present. If you’re not switching to Betterment from a previous provider, you can leave this field blank. &nbsp; After you’re done filling out the document, export the file as a CSV. &nbsp; Upload your CSV file to Betterment. &nbsp; If you receive any errors after uploading your file, review the errors and make changes to your CSV file. Re-upload the file to Betterment after making changes. &nbsp; Once your file is accepted without any errors, you’ll be asked to review the names of the newly created employees. This helps ensure that you’re uploading the correct file to your plan. When you’re done reviewing, click the ‘add employees’ button. &nbsp; Next, the upload process will begin. Once your employees have been uploaded, they’ll receive an email inviting them to complete the sign-up process. &nbsp; Finally, check the employees page to make sure there are no outstanding errors that occurred during the employee creation process. Address any errors that may have occurred. &nbsp; You’re all set! All new participant profiles will be visible on the employees page. You can return to the employees page to make changes to an employee’s profile at any time. &nbsp; Frequently Asked Questions Do I have to do anything else? Nope! You’re all set. Betterment will email all required disclosures to your new plan participants. Do I have to send any notices to my employees? No, Betterment will send all notices to your employees automatically via email. When will my employees be alerted? Employees will be notified by email as soon as their account is created. How can my employees join the plan after I upload their information to Betterment? Employees can check their email for an invite from Betterment to complete the sign-up process. My employee has a P.O. Box as their address. Can I use that address with Betterment? No– to comply with regulations for opening accounts, we require a physical address to verify an employee's identity. Betterment will not send physical mail to an employee’s address (unless they opt into paper statements, which is rare); we will only use the address for account verification. Questions? Contact us.

      Guide to Meeting Your 401(k) Fiduciary Responsibilities  To help your business avoid any pitfalls, this guide outlines how you can fulfill your 401(k) fiduciary responsibilities and manage them properly. If your company has or is considering, a 401(k) plan, you’ve probably heard the term “fiduciary.” But what does it mean to you as a 401(k) plan sponsor? Simply put, being a fiduciary means that you’re obligated to act in the best interests of your 401(k) plan participants. It’s serious business. If fiduciary responsibilities aren’t managed properly, your business could face serious legal and financial ramifications. To help you avoid any pitfalls, this guide outlines how you can fulfill your 401(k) fiduciary responsibilities. A brief history of the 401(k) plan and fiduciary duties When Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1978, it included the little-known provision that eventually (and somewhat accidentally) led to the 401(k) plan. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, referred to as ERISA, is a companion federal law that contains rules designed to protect employee savings by requiring individuals and entities that manage a retirement plan, referred to as “fiduciaries,” to follow strict standards of conduct. Among other responsibilities, fiduciaries must always act in the best interests of employees who save in the plan and avoid conflicts of interest. When you adopt a 401(k) plan for your employees, you become an ERISA fiduciary. And in exchange for helping employees build retirement savings, you and your employees receive special tax benefits, as outlined in the Internal Revenue Code. The IRS oversees the tax rules, and the Department of Labor (DOL) provides guidance on ERISA fiduciary requirements and enforcement. As you can imagine, following these rules can sometimes feel like navigating a maze. But the good news is that an experienced 401(k) provider like Betterment can help you understand your fiduciary duties and even shoulder some of the responsibility for you. Key fiduciary responsibilities Even if you’re a business owner with a small 401(k) plan, you still have fiduciary duties. By sponsoring a retirement plan, you take on two sets of fiduciary responsibilities: &nbsp; You are considered the “named fiduciary” with overall responsibility for the plan, including selecting and monitoring plan investments. &nbsp; You are also considered the “plan administrator” with fiduciary authority and discretion over how the plan is operated. 401(k) fiduciary responsibility checklist As a fiduciary, you must follow the high standards of conduct required by ERISA both when managing your plan’s investments and when making decisions about plan operations. As a 401(k) fiduciary, you must follow five cornerstone rules: Act in employees’ best interests—Every decision you make about your plan must be solely based on what is best for your participants and their beneficiaries. Act prudently—Prudence requires that you be knowledgeable about retirement plan investments and administration. If you do not have the expertise to handle all of these responsibilities, you will need to engage the services of those who do, such as investment managers or recordkeepers. Diversify plan investments—You must diversify investments to help reduce the risk of large losses to plan assets. Follow the plan documents—You must follow the terms of the plan document when operating your plan (unless they are inconsistent with ERISA). Pay only reasonable plan fees—Fees from plan assets must be reasonable and for services that are necessary for your plan. Detailed DOL rules outline the steps you must take to fulfill this fiduciary responsibility, including collecting fee disclosures for investments and service providers, and comparing (or benchmarking) fees to ensure they are reasonable. You don’t have to pay a lot to get a quality 401(k) plan Betterment’s 401(k) administration fees are one of the lowest in the industry, and we always tell you what they are so there are no surprises for you—and more money working harder for your employees. Plus, since we serve as both a 3(16) administrative fiduciary and 3(38) investment fiduciary, we can help limit your risk exposure so you can focus on running your business--not managing your plan. Why it’s important to fulfill your fiduciary duties Put simply, it’s incredibly important that you meet your 401(k) fiduciary responsibilities. Not only are your actions critical to your employees’ futures, but there are also serious consequences if you fail to fulfill your fiduciary duties. In fact, plan participants and other plan fiduciaries have the right to sue to correct any financial wrongdoing. If the plan is mismanaged, you face a two-fold risk: Civil and criminal action (including expensive penalties) from the government and the potentially high price of rectifying the issue. Under ERISA, fiduciaries are personally liable for plan losses caused by a breach of fiduciary responsibilities and may be required to: Restore plan losses (including interest) Pay expenses relating to correction of inappropriate actions. While your fiduciary responsibilities can seem daunting, the good news is that ERISA also allows you to delegate many of your fiduciary responsibilities to 401(k) professionals like Betterment. How to be the best 401(k) fiduciary you can be Now that you understand what a 401(k) fiduciary is, you may be wondering how to best fulfill your fiduciary responsibilities. Here are some tips: Pay reasonable fees—As you know, fees can really chip away at your participants’ account balances—and have a detrimental impact on their futures. So take care to ensure that the services you’re paying for are necessary for the plan and that the fees paid from plan assets are reasonable. To determine what’s reasonable you may need to benchmark the fees against those of other similar retirement plans. Your 401(k) provider should be able to assist you with the benchmarking process. Deposit participant contributions in a timely manner —This may seem simple, but it’s extremely important to do it quickly and accurately. Specifically, you must deposit participants’ contributions to your plan’s trust account on the earliest date they can be reasonably segregated from general corporate assets. The timelines differ depending on your plan size: Small plan—If your plan has fewer than 100 participants, a deposit is considered timely if it’s made within seven business days from the date the contributions are withheld from employees’ wages. Large plan— If your plan has 100 participants or more, you must deposit contributions as soon as possible after you withhold the money from employees’ wages. It must be “timely,” which means typically within a few days.For all businesses, the deposit should never occur later than the 15th business day of the month after the contributions were withheld from employee wages. However, contributions should be deposited well before then. Fulfill your reporting and disclosure requirements—Under ERISA, you are required to fulfill specific reporting requirements. While the paperwork can be complicated, an experienced 401(k) provider like Betterment should be able to guide you through the process.It’s important to note that if required government reports—such as Form 5500—aren’t filed in a timely manner, you may be assessed financial penalties. Plus, when required disclosures—such as safe harbor notices—aren’t provided to participants in a timely manner, the consequences can also be severe including civil penalties, plan disqualification by the IRS, or participant lawsuits. Follow the plan document—It’s important to know your plan document. In fact, the IRS mandates that 401(k) plans operate in accordance with the terms of its written document to maintain its tax-favored status and prevent a breach of fiduciary duty.Make a mistake? The IRS considers the issue an “operational defect,” and your 401(k) plan can be disqualified for not fixing the problem in a timely manner. However, the IRS offers a handy 401(k) Plan Fix-It Guide to help you resolve any issues that crop up. Select prudent investments—Unfortunately, there can be many hidden fees buried in plan investments, so it’s critical to be vigilant about those you select. In addition to fee considerations, you must also think about whether they meet your plan’s investment objectives. Wondering which investments you should choose? Betterment can help.In fact, most companies hire one or more outside experts (such as an investment advisor, investment manager, or third party administrator) to help them manage their fiduciary responsibilities. Get help shouldering your fiduciary responsibilities When it comes to managing your fiduciary responsibilities, you don’t have to go it alone. However, the act of hiring 401(k) experts is a fiduciary decision! Even though you can appoint others to carry out most of your fiduciary responsibilities, you can never fully transfer or eliminate your role as an ERISA fiduciary. You will always retain the fiduciary responsibility for selecting and monitoring your plan’s investment professionals and administrators. How much support is right for you? For most employers, day-to-day business responsibilities leave little time for extensive investment research, analysis, and fee benchmarking. Many companies hire outside experts to take on the fiduciary investment duties or even plan administration responsibilities. Take a look at the chart below to see the different fiduciary roles—and the implications they have for you as the employer: Defined in ERISA section Outside expert Employer No Fiduciary Status Disclaims any fiduciary investment responsibility Retains sole fiduciary responsibility and liability 3(21) Shares fiduciary investment responsibility in the form of investment recommendations Retains responsibility for final investment discretion 3(38) Assumes full discretionary authority for assets and investments Relieves employer of investment fiduciary responsibility 3(16) Has discretionary responsibility for certain administrative aspects of the plan Relieves employer of certain plan administration responsibility Betterment can help When you appoint an ERISA 3(38) investment manager like Betterment, you fully delegate responsibility for selecting and monitoring plan investments to the investment manager. That means less work for you and your staff, so you can focus on your business. In addition to assuming fiduciary responsibility for your investment options, Betterment offers: Consultative plan sponsor support— As a total 401(k) solution, we are your full-service partner, including fiduciary services to plan design consulting and ongoing plan management support, helping ensure your 401(k) is set up for success.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      What is a 401(k) QDIA?  A QDIA (Qualified Default Investment Alternative) is the plan’s default investment. When money is contributed to the plan, it’s automatically invested in the QDIA. What is a QDIA? A 401(k) QDIA (Qualified Default Investment Alternative) is the investment used when an employee contributes to the plan without having specified how the money should be invested. As a "safe harbor," a QDIA relieves the employer from liability should the QDIA suffer investment losses. Here’s how it works: When money is contributed to the plan, it’s automatically invested in the QDIA that was selected by the plan fiduciary (typically, the business owner or the plan sponsor). The employee can leave the money in the QDIA or transfer it to another plan investment. When (and why) was the QDIA introduced? The concept of a QDIA was first introduced when the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) was signed into law. Designed to boost employee retirement savings, the PPA removed barriers that prevented employers from adopting automatic enrollment. At the time, fears about legal liability for market fluctuations and the applicability of state wage withholding laws had prevented many employers from adopting automatic enrollment—or had led them to select low-risk, low-return options as default investments. The PPA eliminated those fears by amending the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to provide a safe harbor for plan fiduciaries who invest participant assets in certain types of default investment alternatives when participants do not give investment direction. To assist employers in selecting QDIAs that met employees’ long-term retirement needs, the Department of Labor (DOL) issued a final regulation detailing the characteristics of these investments. Learn more about what kinds of investments qualify as QDIAs below. Why does having a QDIA matter? When a 401(k) plan has a QDIA that meets the DOL’s rules, then the plan fiduciary is not liable for the QDIA’s investment performance. Without a QDIA, the plan fiduciary is potentially liable for investment losses when participants don’t actively direct their plan investments. Plus, having a QDIA in place means that employee accounts are well positioned—even if an active investment decision is never taken. If you select an appropriate default investment for your plan, you can feel confident knowing that your employees’ retirement dollars are invested in a vehicle that offers the potential for growth. Does my retirement plan need a QDIA? Yes, it’s a smart idea for all plans to have a QDIA. That’s because, at some point, money may be contributed to the plan, and participants may not have an investment election on file. This could happen in a number of situations, including when money is contributed to an account but no active investment elections have been established, such as when an employer makes a contribution but an employee isn’t contributing to the plan; or when an employee rolls money into the 401(k) plan prior to making investment elections. It makes sense then, that plans with automatic enrollment must have a QDIA. Are there any other important QDIA regulations that I need to know about? Yes, the DOL details several conditions plan sponsors must follow in order to obtain safe harbor relief from fiduciary liability for investment outcomes, including: A notice generally must be provided to participants and beneficiaries in advance of their first QDIA investment, and then on an annual basis after that Information about the QDIA must be provided to participants and beneficiaries which must include the following: An explanation of the employee’s rights under the plan to designate how the contributions will be invested; An explanation of how assets will be invested if no action taken regarding investment election; Description of the actual QDIA, which includes the investment objectives, characteristics of risk and return, and any fees and expenses involved Participants and beneficiaries must have the opportunity to direct investments out of a QDIA as frequently as other plan investments, but at least quarterly For more information, consult the DOL fact sheet. What kinds of investments qualify as QDIAs? The DOL regulations don’t identify specific investment products. Instead, they describe mechanisms for investing participant contributions in a way that meets long-term retirement saving needs. Specifically, there are four types of QDIAs: An investment service that allocates contributions among existing plan options to provide an asset mix that takes into account the individual’s age or retirement date (for example, a professionally managed account like the one offered by Betterment) A product with a mix of investments that takes into account the individual’s age or retirement date (for example, a life-cycle or target-date fund) A product with a mix of investments that takes into account the characteristics of the group of employees as a whole, rather than each individual (for example, a balanced fund) The fourth type of QDIA is a capital preservation product, such as a stable value fund, that can only be used for the first 120 days of participation. This may be an option for Eligible Automatic Contribution Arrangement (EACA) plans that allow withdrawals of unintended deferrals within the first 90 days without penalty. We’re excluding further discussion of this option here since plans must still have one of the other QDIAs in cases where the participant takes no action within the first 120 days. What are the pros and cons of each type of QDIA? Let’s breakdown each of the first three QDIAs: 1. An investment service that allocates contributions among existing plan options to provide an asset mix that takes into account the individual’s age or retirement date Such an investment service, or managed account, is often preferred as a QDIA over the other options because they can be much more personalized. This is the QDIA provided as part of Betterment 401(k)s. Betterment factors in more than just age (or years to retirement) when assigning participants their particular stock-to-bond ratio within our Core portfolios. We utilize specific data including salary, balance, state of residence, plan rules, and more. And while managed accounts can be pricey, they don’t have to be. Betterment’s solution, which is relatively lower in cost due to investing in exchange traded funds (ETFs) portfolios, offers personalized advice and an easy-to-use platform that can also take external and spousal/partner accounts into consideration. 2. A product with a mix of investments that takes into account the individual’s age or retirement date When QDIAs were introduced in 2006, target date funds were the preferred default investment. The concept is simple: pick the target date fund with the year that most closely matches the year the investor plans to retire. For example, in 2020 if the investor is 45 and retirement is 20 years away, the 2040 Target Date Fund would be selected. As the investor moves closer to their retirement date, the fund adjusts its asset mix to become more conservative. One common criticism of target date funds today is that the personalization ends there. Target date funds are too simple and their one-size-fits-all portfolio allocations do not serve any individual investor very well. Plus, target date funds are often far more expensive compared to other alternatives. Finally, most target date funds are composed of investments from the same company—and very few fund companies excel at investing across every sector and asset class. Many experts view target date funds as outdated QDIAs and less desirable than managed accounts. 3. A product with a mix of investments that takes into account the characteristics of the group of employees as a whole&nbsp; This kind of product—for example, a balanced fund—offers a mix of equity and fixed-income investments. However, it’s based on group demographics and not on the retirement needs of individual participants. Therefore, using a balanced fund as a QDIA is a blunt instrument that by definition will have an investment mix that is either too heavily weighted to one asset class or another for most participants in your plan. Better QDIAs—and better 401(k) plans Betterment provides tailored allocation advice based on what each individual investor needs. That means greater personalization—and potentially greater investment results—for your employees. At Betterment, we monitor plan participants’ investing progress to make sure they’re on track to reach their goals. When they’re not on target, we provide actionable advice to help get them back on track. As a 3(38) investment manager, we assume full responsibility for selecting and monitoring plan investments—including your QDIA. That means fiduciary relief for you and better results for your employees. The exchange-traded fund (ETF) difference Another key component that sets Betterment apart from the competition is our exclusive use of ETFs. Here's why we use them: Low cost—ETFs generally cost less than mutual funds, which means more money stays invested. Diversified—All of the portfolios used by Betterment are designed with diversification in mind, so that investors are not overly exposed to individual stocks, bonds, sectors, or countries—which may mean better returns in the long run. Efficient—ETFs take advantage of decades of technological advances in buying, selling, and pricing securities. Helping your employees live better Our mission is simple: to empower people to do what’s best for their money so they can live better. Betterment’s suite of financial wellness solutions, from our QDIAs to our user-friendly investment platform, is designed to give your employees a more personalized experience. We invite you to learn more about what we can do for you.

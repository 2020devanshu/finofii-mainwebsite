    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Are 401(k) Contributions Tax Deductible for Employers? Seize the tax deductions (and credits!). Contributing to employees’ 401(k) accounts may cost less than you think. Vehicle expenses. Salaries. Office supplies. Rent. Utilities. Many business expenses can be claimed as tax deductions. But did you know that 401(k) plan contributions offer significant tax benefits, too? Read on to discover all the ways you can save on your tax bill. Snag the tax deductions Great news! Whether you decide to make employer matching contributions, profit sharing contributions, or safe harbor contributions to employee retirement accounts, they’re tax deductible. That means that you can subtract the value from your company’s taxable income. According to the IRS, employer contributions are deductible as long as they “don’t exceed the limitations described in section 404 of the Internal Revenue Code.” Wondering about the limits? Well, in 2020 the employer contribution limit is 25% of an employee’s compensation (eligible compensation is limited to $285,000 per participant). In addition, combined employer and employee contributions are limited to the lessor of $57,000 or 100% of the employee’s annual compensation. The tax benefits don’t end there… In addition to claiming big deductions by making employer contributions to your retirement plan, you can also save on taxes in a multitude of other ways. 1. 401(k) administration fees—Administrative fees are typically a business tax deduction. So not only does paying for administrative fees reduce the amount that comes out of individual 401(k) accounts, but they qualify as a business expense, thus reducing your business taxable income. 2. SECURE Act tax credits—Thanks to the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019 (the SECURE Act), you may be eligible for valuable tax credits for small employers. Even more valuable than a tax deduction, a tax credit subtracts the value from the taxes you owe! Plus, you can claim these credits for the first three years the plan or feature is in place: Tax credit for new plans—You may now be able to claim annual tax credits of 50% of the cost to establish and administer a retirement savings plan, up to the greater of: &nbsp;$500; or &nbsp;the lesser of: $250 per eligible non-highly compensated employee eligible for the plan; and $5,000. (Up to $15,000 in tax credits over three years!) Tax credit for adding eligible automatic enrollment—Earn an additional $500 annual tax credit for adding an eligible automatic enrollment feature to your new or existing plan. (Up to $1,500 in tax credits over three years!) 3. Benefit from your own contributions—Plan on contributing to your own 401(k) plan? You’ll save on your own taxes, too! In 2020, you can contribute up to $19,500 to your 401(k), and if you’re age 50 or older, you can make additional catch-up contributions of up to $6,500. Select either: Traditional 401(k) contributions with pretax dollars to enjoy the benefits of tax-deferred saving; or Roth 401(k) contributions with post-tax dollars, enabling you to make tax-free withdrawals in retirement Plus, offering your employees matching, profit-sharing, or safe harbor contributions may mean that you can increase your own personal contributions. That’s because, due to the mechanics of discrimination testing, higher 401(k) contributions made by non-highly compensated employees may help to increase allowable contributions for highly compensated employees. Learn more now. Reward your employees (and improve your company’s productivity) In addition to helping retain existing employees, a match is a powerful recruitment tool. In fact, a recent Betterment for Business study found that, for more than 45 percent of respondents, an employer’s decision to offer a 401(k) match was a factor in whether or not they took the job. Plus, you’d be surprised at the hidden costs of not offering an employer contribution. Just look at employee replacement and retention costs. When employers do not help facilitate employee retirement planning, they may be surprised by other costs that could rise, including higher relative salaries (beyond what might have been planned for), higher healthcare costs, or costs associated with loss of productivity. If the connection seems hard to believe, take a look at the research. According to a study from Prudential, every year an employee delays their retirement, it can cost their employer more than $50,000 due to a combination of factors including higher relative salaries, higher health care costs, younger employee retention through promotion, and several other elements. For companies that may be less concerned with an aging employee population, forgoing matches can still contribute to rising retention and replacement costs due to the impact of financial distress on employee performance. In a survey by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), which measured the impact of personal financial stress on employee performance, 47% of HR professionals noticed that employees struggle with their “ability to focus on work.” Poor productivity not only costs the business in output, but can inevitably lead to higher employee turnover, which can lead to higher costs associated with retention and hiring. Make a smart compensation decision Are you debating between giving employees a raise and offering them a 401(k) plan contribution? Consider this example using $3,000. A $3,000 increase in base pay will mean a net increase to the employee of just $2,250, assuming 25% in income taxes and FICA combined. For the employer, that increase will cost $2,422.12, after FICA adjusted for a 25% in income tax rate. Employee Income After-Tax Employer Net Cost $3,000.00 Increased Pay $3,000.00 Increased Payroll ($750.00) Taxes @ 25% $229.50 FICA @ 7.65% &nbsp; &nbsp; ($807.38) Tax Deduction @ 25% $2,250.00 Net Paycheck $2,422.12 Net Cost Alternatively, a $3,000 contribution to an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan results in no FICA for either the employee or the employer.&nbsp; The employee would receive the full benefit of that $3,000 today on a pre-tax basis PLUS it would grow tax-free until retirement. As the employer, your tax deduction on that 401(k) contribution would be $750, meaning your cost is just $2,250 —or 7% less than if you had provided a $3,000 salary increase. Betterment can help boost tax savings even more... After you set up your 401(k) plan with Betterment, your employees can start investing for retirement and save on current taxes if they decide to save on a pre-tax basis. But Betterment provides additional tax saving strategies for those employees with two or more Betterment account types (including pre-tax 401(k) and Roth 401(k), but also a retail account) can have their investments optimized by using our Tax Coordination feature at no additional cost. This strategy generally places your least tax-efficient assets in your tax-advantaged accounts (like pre-tax 401(k)s), which already have big tax breaks, while diverting the most tax-efficient assets to your taxable accounts. …And help you take care of the paperwork You may be wondering: “Do I need to report 401(k) contributions?” The answer is “yes.” Specifically,&nbsp; employees’ contributions must be reported on their Form W2, Wage and Tax Statement, and Form W-3, Transmittal of Wage &amp; Tax Statement. In addition, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), you are required to fulfill specific 401(k) plan reporting requirements, which include detailing employer and employee 401(k) contributions. While the paperwork can be complicated, an experienced 401(k) provider like Betterment can guide you through the process. Take the next step If you’re ready to get started, Betterment makes it easy for you to offer your employees a better 401(k) at a fraction of the cost of most providers. As your full-service 401(k) partner, we can help you: Design a plan with compelling features like automatic enrollment and employer contributions Select and monitor plan investments (Betterment assumes full responsibility as a 3(38) investment manager) Offer your employees personalized guidance to help them make strides toward their long- and short-term goals ranging from saving for retirement to paying down debt Manage important compliance and reporting requirements A Betterment 401(k) plan could be better for you—and better for your employees.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Everything You Need to Know About 401(k) Blackout Periods Maybe you’ve heard of a 401(k) blackout period, but if you don’t know exactly what it is or how to explain it to your employees, read on. You’ve probably heard of a 401(k) plan blackout period – but do you know what it is and how to explain it to your employees? Read on for answers to the most frequently asked questions about blackout periods. What is a blackout period? A blackout period is a time when participants are not able to access their 401(k) accounts because a major plan change is being made. During this time, they are not allowed to direct their investments, change their contribution rate or amount, make transfers, or take loans or distributions. However, plan assets remain invested during the blackout period. In addition, participants can continue to make contributions and loan repayments, which will continue to be invested according to the latest elections on file. Participants will be able to see these inflows and any earnings in their accounts once the blackout period has ended. When is a blackout period necessary? Typically, a blackout period is necessary when: 401(k) plan assets and records are being moved from one retirement plan provider to another &nbsp;New employees are added to a company’s plan during a merger or acquisition Available investment options are being modified Blackout periods are a normal and necessary part of 401(k) administration during such events to ensure that records and assets are accurately accounted for and reconciled. In these circumstances, participant accounts must be valued (and potentially liquidated) so that funds can be reinvested in new options. In the event of a plan provider change, the former provider must formally pass the data and assets to the new plan provider. Therefore, accounts must be frozen on a temporary basis before the transition. How long does a blackout period last? A blackout period usually lasts about 10 business days. However, it may need to be extended due to unforeseen circumstances, which are rare; but there is no legal maximum limit for a blackout period. Regardless, you must give advance notice to your employees that a blackout is on the horizon. What kind of notice do I have to give my employees about a blackout period? Is your blackout going to last for more than three days? If so, you’re required by federal law to send a written notice of the blackout period to all of your plan participants and beneficiaries. The notice must be sent at least 30 days – but no more than 60 days – prior to the start of the blackout. Typically, your plan provider will provide you with language so that you can send an appropriate blackout notice to your plan participants. If you are moving your plan from another provider to Betterment, we will coordinate with your previous recordkeeper to establish a timeline for the transfer, including the timing and expected duration of the blackout period. Betterment will draft a blackout notice on your behalf to provide to your employees, which will include the following: Reason for the blackout Identification of any investments subject to the blackout period Description of the rights otherwise available to participants and beneficiaries under the plan that will be temporarily suspended, limited, or restricted The expected beginning and ending date of the blackout A statement that participants should evaluate the appropriateness of their current investment decisions in light of their inability to direct or diversify assets during the blackout period If at least 30 days-notice cannot be given, an explanation of why advance notice could not be provided The name, address, and telephone number of the plan administrator or other individual who can answer questions about the blackout Who should receive the blackout notice? All plan participants with a balance should receive the blackout notice, regardless of their employment status with your company. In addition, we suggest sending the notice to eligible active employees, even if they currently don’t have a balance, since they may wish to start contributing and should be made aware of the upcoming blackout period. What should I say if my employees are concerned about an upcoming blackout period? Reassure your employees that a blackout period is normal and that it’s a necessary event that happens when significant plan changes are made. Also, encourage them to look at their accounts and make any changes they see fit prior to the start of the blackout period. Thinking about changing plan providers? If you’re thinking about changing plan providers, but are concerned about the ramifications of a blackout period, know that Betterment is here to help. Our team is here to guide you through the process, and we are committed to making the transition as seamless as possible for you and your participants.

    <p class="item-title">Understanding 401(k) Fees</p>

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Understanding 401(k) Fees Come retirement time, the number of 401(k) plan fees charged can make a major difference in your employees’ account balances—and their futures. Did&nbsp;you know that the smallest 401(k) plans often pay the most in fees? We believe that you don’t have to pay high fees to provide your employees with a top-notch 401(k) plan. In fact, Betterment offers comprehensive plan solutions at one of the lowest costs in the industry. Why do 401(k) fees matter? The difference between a 1% fee and a 2% fee may not sound like much, but in reality, higher 401(k) fees can take a major bite out of your participants’ retirement savings. Consider this example: Triplets Jane, Julie, and Janet each began investing in their employers’ 401(k) plan at the age of 25. Each had a starting salary of $50,000, increased by 3% annually, and contributed 6% of their pre-tax salary with no company matching contribution. Their investments returned 6% annually. The only difference is that their retirement accounts were charged annual 401(k) fees of 1%, 1.5%, and 2%, respectively. Forty years later, they’re all thinking about retiring and decide to compare their account balances. Here’s what they look like: &nbsp; Annual 401(k) fee Account balance at age 65 Jane 1% $577,697 Julie 1.5% $517,856 Janet 2% $465,894 Information is hypothetical and provided for educational purposes only. As such, these figures do not reflect Betterment’s management fee and do not reflect any actual client performance As you can see, come retirement time, the amount of fees charged can make a major difference in your employees’ account balances—and their futures. Why should employers care about 401(k) fees? You care about your employees, so naturally, you want to help them build brighter futures. But beyond that, it’s your fiduciary duty as a plan sponsor to make sure you’re only paying reasonable 401(k) fees for services that are necessary for your plan. The Department of Labor (DOL) outlines rules that you must follow to fulfill this fiduciary responsibility, including “ensuring that the services provided to the plan are necessary and that the cost of those services is reasonable” and has published a guide to assist you in this process. Generally, any firm providing services of $1,000 or more to your 401(k) plan is required to provide a fee disclosure, which is the first step in understanding your plan’s fees and expenses. It’s important to note that the regulations do not require you to ensure your fees are the lowest available, but that they are reasonable given the level and quality of service and support you and your employees receive. Benchmark the fees against similar retirement plans (by number of employees and plan assets, for example) to see if they’re reasonable.&nbsp; What are the main types of fees? Typically, 401(k) fees fall into three categories: administrative fees, individual service fees, and investment fees. Let’s dig a little deeper into each category: Plan administration fees—Paid to your 401(k) provider, plan administration fees typically cover 401(k) set-up fees, as well as general expenses such as recordkeeping, communications, support, legal, and trustee services. These costs are often assessed as a flat annual fee. Investment fees—Investment fees, typically assessed as a percentage of assets under management, may take two forms: fund fees that are expressed as an expense ratio or percentage of assets, and investment advisory fees for portfolio construction and the ongoing management of the plan assets. Betterment, for instance, acts as investment advisor to its 401(k) clients, assuming full fiduciary responsibility for the selection and monitoring of funds. And as is also the case with Betterment, the investment advisory fee may even include personalized investment advice for every employee. Individual service fees—If participants elect certain services—such as taking out a 401(k) loan—they may be assessed individual fees for each service. Wondering what you and your employees are paying in 401(k) fees? Fund fees are detailed in the funds’ prospectuses and are often wrapped up into one figure known as the expense ratio, expressed as a percentage of assets. Other fees are described in agreements with your service providers. High quality, low fees Typically, mutual funds have dominated the retirement investment landscape, but in recent years, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become increasingly popular. At Betterment, we believe that a portfolio of ETFs, in conjunction with personalized, unbiased advice, is the ideal solution for today’s retirement savers. Who pays 401(k) fees: the employer or the participant? The short answer is that it depends. As the employer, you may have options with respect to whether certain fees may be allocated to plan participants. Expenses incurred as a result of plan-related business expenses (so-called “ settlor expenses”) cannot be paid from plan assets. An example of such an expense would be a consulting fee related to the decision to offer a plan in the first place. Other costs associated with plan administration are eligible to be charged to plan assets. Of course, just because certain expenses can be paid by plan assets doesn’t mean you are off the hook in monitoring them and ensuring they remain reasonable. Plan administration fees are often paid by the employer. While it could be a significant financial responsibility for you as the business owner, there are three significant upsides: &nbsp; Reduced fiduciary liability—As you read, paying excessive fees is a major source of fiduciary liability. If you pay for the fees from a corporate account, you reduce potential liability. &nbsp; Lowered income taxes—If your company pays for the administration fees, they’re tax deductible! Plus, you can potentially save even more with the new SECURE Act tax credits for starting a new plan and for adding automatic enrollment. &nbsp; Increased 401(k) returns—Do you take part in your own 401(k) plan? If so, paying 401(k) fees from company assets means you’ll be keeping more of your personal retirement savings. Fund fees are tied to the individual investment options in each participant’s portfolio. Therefore, these fees are paid from each participant’s plan assets. Individual service fees are also paid directly by investors who elect the service, for example, taking a plan loan. How can you minimize your 401(k) fees? Minimizing your fees starts with the 401(k) provider you choose. In the past, the price for 401(k) plan administration was quite high. However, things have changed, and now the era of expensive, impersonal, unguided retirement saving is over. Innovative companies like Betterment now offer comprehensive plan solutions at a fraction of the cost of most providers. Betterment combines the power of efficient technology with personalized advice so that employers can provide a benefit that’s truly a benefit, and employees can know that they’re invested correctly for retirement. No hidden fees. Maximum transparency. Costs are often passed to the employee through fund fees, and in fact, mutual fund pricing structures incorporate non-investment fees that can be used to pay for other types of expenses. Because they are embedded in mutual fund expense ratios, they may not be explicit, therefore making it difficult for you to know exactly how much you and your employees are paying. In other words, most mutual funds in 401(k) plans contain hidden fees. At Betterment, we believe in transparency. Our use of ETFs means there are no hidden fees, so you and your employees are able to know how much you’re paying for the underlying investments themselves. Plus, our pricing structure unbundles the key offerings we provide—advisory, investment, record keeping, and compliance—and assigns a fee to each service. A clearly defined fee structure means no surprises for you—and more money working harder for your employees.

    <p class="item-title">What is a 401(k) QDIA?</p>

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      What is a 401(k) QDIA? A QDIA (Qualified Default Investment Alternative) is the plan’s default investment. When money is contributed to the plan, it’s automatically invested in the QDIA. What is a QDIA? A 401(k) QDIA (Qualified Default Investment Alternative) is the investment used when an employee contributes to the plan without having specified how the money should be invested. As a "safe harbor," a QDIA relieves the employer from liability should the QDIA suffer investment losses. Here’s how it works: When money is contributed to the plan, it’s automatically invested in the QDIA that was selected by the plan fiduciary (typically, the business owner or the plan sponsor). The employee can leave the money in the QDIA or transfer it to another plan investment. When (and why) was the QDIA introduced? The concept of a QDIA was first introduced when the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) was signed into law. Designed to boost employee retirement savings, the PPA removed barriers that prevented employers from adopting automatic enrollment. At the time, fears about legal liability for market fluctuations and the applicability of state wage withholding laws had prevented many employers from adopting automatic enrollment—or had led them to select low-risk, low-return options as default investments. The PPA eliminated those fears by amending the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to provide a safe harbor for plan fiduciaries who invest participant assets in certain types of default investment alternatives when participants do not give investment direction. To assist employers in selecting QDIAs that met employees’ long-term retirement needs, the Department of Labor (DOL) issued a final regulation detailing the characteristics of these investments. Learn more about what kinds of investments qualify as QDIAs below. Why does having a QDIA matter? When a 401(k) plan has a QDIA that meets the DOL’s rules, then the plan fiduciary is not liable for the QDIA’s investment performance. Without a QDIA, the plan fiduciary is potentially liable for investment losses when participants don’t actively direct their plan investments. Plus, having a QDIA in place means that employee accounts are well positioned—even if an active investment decision is never taken. If you select an appropriate default investment for your plan, you can feel confident knowing that your employees’ retirement dollars are invested in a vehicle that offers the potential for growth. Does my retirement plan need a QDIA? Yes, it’s a smart idea for all plans to have a QDIA. That’s because, at some point, money may be contributed to the plan, and participants may not have an investment election on file. This could happen in a number of situations, including when money is contributed to an account but no active investment elections have been established, such as when an employer makes a contribution but an employee isn’t contributing to the plan; or when an employee rolls money into the 401(k) plan prior to making investment elections. It makes sense then, that plans with automatic enrollment must have a QDIA. Are there any other important QDIA regulations that I need to know about? Yes, the DOL details several conditions plan sponsors must follow in order to obtain safe harbor relief from fiduciary liability for investment outcomes, including: A notice generally must be provided to participants and beneficiaries in advance of their first QDIA investment, and then on an annual basis after that Information about the QDIA must be provided to participants and beneficiaries which must include the following: An explanation of the employee’s rights under the plan to designate how the contributions will be invested; An explanation of how assets will be invested if no action taken regarding investment election; Description of the actual QDIA, which includes the investment objectives, characteristics of risk and return, and any fees and expenses involved Participants and beneficiaries must have the opportunity to direct investments out of a QDIA as frequently as other plan investments, but at least quarterly For more information, consult the DOL fact sheet. What kinds of investments qualify as QDIAs? The DOL regulations don’t identify specific investment products. Instead, they describe mechanisms for investing participant contributions in a way that meets long-term retirement saving needs. Specifically, there are four types of QDIAs: An investment service that allocates contributions among existing plan options to provide an asset mix that takes into account the individual’s age or retirement date (for example, a professionally managed account like the one offered by Betterment) A product with a mix of investments that takes into account the individual’s age or retirement date (for example, a life-cycle or target-date fund) A product with a mix of investments that takes into account the characteristics of the group of employees as a whole, rather than each individual (for example, a balanced fund) The fourth type of QDIA is a capital preservation product, such as a stable value fund, that can only be used for the first 120 days of participation. This may be an option for Eligible Automatic Contribution Arrangement (EACA) plans that allow withdrawals of unintended deferrals within the first 90 days without penalty. We’re excluding further discussion of this option here since plans must still have one of the other QDIAs in cases where the participant takes no action within the first 120 days. What are the pros and cons of each type of QDIA? Let’s breakdown each of the first three QDIAs: 1. An investment service that allocates contributions among existing plan options to provide an asset mix that takes into account the individual’s age or retirement date Such an investment service, or managed account, is often preferred as a QDIA over the other options because they can be much more personalized. This is the QDIA provided as part of Betterment 401(k)s. Betterment factors in more than just age (or years to retirement) when assigning participants their particular stock-to-bond ratio within our Core portfolios. We utilize specific data including salary, balance, state of residence, plan rules, and more. And while managed accounts can be pricey, they don’t have to be. Betterment’s solution, which is relatively lower in cost due to investing in exchange traded funds (ETFs) portfolios, offers personalized advice and an easy-to-use platform that can also take external and spousal/partner accounts into consideration. 2. A product with a mix of investments that takes into account the individual’s age or retirement date When QDIAs were introduced in 2006, target date funds were the preferred default investment. The concept is simple: pick the target date fund with the year that most closely matches the year the investor plans to retire. For example, in 2020 if the investor is 45 and retirement is 20 years away, the 2040 Target Date Fund would be selected. As the investor moves closer to their retirement date, the fund adjusts its asset mix to become more conservative. One common criticism of target date funds today is that the personalization ends there. Target date funds are too simple and their one-size-fits-all portfolio allocations do not serve any individual investor very well. Plus, target date funds are often far more expensive compared to other alternatives. Finally, most target date funds are composed of investments from the same company—and very few fund companies excel at investing across every sector and asset class. Many experts view target date funds as outdated QDIAs and less desirable than managed accounts. 3. A product with a mix of investments that takes into account the characteristics of the group of employees as a whole&nbsp; This kind of product—for example, a balanced fund—offers a mix of equity and fixed-income investments. However, it’s based on group demographics and not on the retirement needs of individual participants. Therefore, using a balanced fund as a QDIA is a blunt instrument that by definition will have an investment mix that is either too heavily weighted to one asset class or another for most participants in your plan. Better QDIAs—and better 401(k) plans Betterment provides tailored allocation advice based on what each individual investor needs. That means greater personalization—and potentially greater investment results—for your employees. At Betterment, we monitor plan participants’ investing progress to make sure they’re on track to reach their goals. When they’re not on target, we provide actionable advice to help get them back on track. As a 3(38) investment manager, we assume full responsibility for selecting and monitoring plan investments—including your QDIA. That means fiduciary relief for you and better results for your employees. The exchange-traded fund (ETF) difference Another key component that sets Betterment apart from the competition is our exclusive use of ETFs. Here's why we use them: Low cost—ETFs generally cost less than mutual funds, which means more money stays invested. Diversified—All of the portfolios used by Betterment are designed with diversification in mind, so that investors are not overly exposed to individual stocks, bonds, sectors, or countries—which may mean better returns in the long run. Efficient—ETFs take advantage of decades of technological advances in buying, selling, and pricing securities. Helping your employees live better Our mission is simple: to empower people to do what’s best for their money so they can live better. Betterment’s suite of financial wellness solutions, from our QDIAs to our user-friendly investment platform, is designed to give your employees a more personalized experience.

    <p class="item-title">All About Vesting of Employer Contributions</p>

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      All About Vesting of Employer Contributions Employers have flexibility in defining their plan’s vesting schedule, which can be an important employee retention tool. Regardless of age, employees (as well as job seekers), are thinking about saving for their future. 401(k) plans, therefore, are a very attractive benefit and can be an important competitive tool in helping employers attract and retain talent. And when a company sweetens the 401(k) plan with a matching or profit sharing contribution, that’s like “free money” that can be hard for prospective and current employees to pass up. But with employer contributions comes the concept of “vesting,” which both employees and employers should understand. What is Vesting? With respect to retirement plans, “vesting” simply means ownership. In other words, each employee will vest, or own, a portion or all of their account in the plan based on the plan’s vesting schedule. All 401(k) contributions that an employee makes to the plan, including pre-tax and/or Roth contributions made through payroll deduction, are immediately 100% vested. Those contributions were money earned by the employee as compensation, and so they are owned by the employee immediately and completely. Employer contributions made to the plan, however, usually vest according to a plan-specific schedule (called a vesting schedule) which may require the employee to work a certain period of time to be fully vested or “own” those funds. Often ownership in employer contributions is made gradually over a number of years, which can be an effective retention tool by encouraging employees to stay long enough to vest in 100% of their employer contributions. What is a 401(k) Vesting Schedule? The 401(k) vesting schedule is the set of rules outlining how much and when employees are entitled to (some or all of)&nbsp; the employer contributions made to their accounts. Typically, the more years of service, the higher the vesting percentage. Different Types of 401(k) Vesting Schedules Employers have flexibility in determining the type and length of vesting schedule. The three types of vesting are: Immediate Vesting - This is very straight-forward in that the employee is immediately vested (or owns) 100% of employer contributions from the point of receipt. In this case, employees are not required to work a certain number of years to claim ownership of the employer contribution. An employee who was hired in the beginning of the month and received an employer matching contribution in his 401(k) account at the end of the month could leave the company the next day, along with the total amount in his account (employee plus employer contributions). Graded Vesting Schedule - Probably the most common schedule, vesting takes place in a gradual manner. At least 20% of the employer contributions must vest after two years of service and 100% vesting can be achieved after anywhere from two to six years to achieve 100% vesting. Popular graded vesting schedules include: &nbsp; 3-Year Graded 4-Year Graded 5-Year Graded 6-Year Graded Yrs of Service % Vested % Vested % Vested % Vested 0 - 1 33% 25% 20% 0% 1 - 2 66% 50% 40% 20% 2 - 3 100% 75% 60% 40% 3 - 4 &nbsp; 100% 80% 60% 4 - 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; 100% 80% 5 - 6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 100% Cliff Vesting Schedule - With a cliff vesting schedule, the entire employer contribution becomes 100% vested all at once, after a specific period of time. For example, if the company has a 3 year cliff vesting schedule and an employee leaves for a new job after two years, the employee would only be able to take the contributions they made to their 401(k) account; they wouldn’t have any ownership rights to any employer contributions that had been made on their behalf. The maximum number of years for a cliff schedule is 3 years. Popular cliff vesting schedules include: &nbsp; 2-Year Cliff 3-Year Cliff Yrs of Service % Vested % Vested 0 - 1 0% 0% 1 - 2 100% 0% 2 - 3 &nbsp; 100% Frequently Asked Questions about Vesting What is a typical vesting schedule? Vesting schedules can vary for every plan. However, the most common type of vesting schedule is the graded schedule, where the employee will gradually vest over time depending on the years of service required. Can we change our plan’s vesting schedule in the future? Yes, with a word of caution. In order to apply to all employees, the vesting schedule can change only to one that is equally or more generous than the existing vesting schedule. Known as the anti-cutback rule, this prevents plan sponsors from taking away benefits that have already accrued to employees. For example, if a plan has a 4-year graded vesting schedule, it could not be amended to a 5- or 6-year graded vesting schedule (unless the plan is willing to maintain separate vesting schedules for new hires versus existing employees). The same plan could, however, amend its vesting schedule to a 3-year graded one, since the new benefit would be more generous than the previous one. Since my plan doesn't currently offer employer contributions, I don't need to worry about defining a vesting schedule, right? Whether or not your organization plans on making 401(k) employer contributions, for maximum flexibility, we recommend that all plans include provisions for discretionary employer contributions and a more restrictive vesting formula. The discretionary provision in no way obligates the employer to make contributions (the employer could decide each year whether to contribute or not, and how much). In addition, having a restrictive vesting schedule means that the vesting schedule could be amended easily in the future. When does a vesting period begin? Usually, a vesting period begins when an employee is hired so that even if the 401(k) plan is established years after an employee has started working at the company, all of the year(s) of service prior to the plan’s establishment will be counted towards their vesting. However, this is not always the case. The plan document may have been written such that the vesting period starts only after the plan has been in effect. This means that if an employee was hired prior to a 401(k) plan being established, the year(s) of service prior to the plan’s effective date will not be counted. What are the methods of counting service for vesting? Service for vesting can be calculated in two ways: hours of service or elapsed time. With the hours of service method, an employer can define 1,000 hours of service as a year of service so that an employee can earn a year of vesting service in as little as five or six months (assuming 190 hours worked per month). The employer must be diligent in tracking the hours worked to make sure vesting is calculated correctly for each employee and to avoid over-forfeiting or over-distributing employer contributions. The challenges of tracking hours of service often lead employers to favor the elapsed time method. With this method, a year of vesting is calculated based on years from the employee’s date of hire. If an employee is still active 12 months from their date of hire, then they will be credited with one year of service toward vesting, regardless of the hours or days worked at the company. If there is an eligibility requirement to be a part of the plan, does vesting start after an employee becomes an eligible participant in the plan? Typically, no, but it is dependent on what has been written into the plan document. As stated previously, the vesting clock usually starts ticking when the employee is hired. An employee may not be able to join the plan because there’s a separate eligibility requirement that must be met (for example, 6 months of service), but the eligibility computation period is completely separate from the vesting period. The only instance where an ineligible participant may not start vesting from their date of hire is if the plan document excludes years of service of an employee who has not reached the age of 18. How long does an employer have to deposit employer contributions to the 401(k) plan? This is dependent on how the plan document is written. If the plan document is written for employer contributions to be made every pay period, then the plan sponsor must follow their fiduciary duty to make sure that the employer contribution is made on time. If the plan document is written so that the contribution can be made on an annual basis, then the employer can wait until the end of the year ( or even until the plan goes through their annual compliance testing) to wait for the contribution calculations to be received from their provider. What happens to an employer contribution that is not vested? If an employee leaves the company before they are fully vested, then the unvested portion (including associated earnings) will be “forfeited” and returned to the employer’s plan cash account, which can be used to fund future employer contributions or pay for plan expenses. For example, if a 401(k) plan has a 6-year graded vesting schedule and an employee terminates service after only 5 years,&nbsp; 80% of the employer contribution will belong to the employee, and the remaining 20% will be sent back to the employer when the employee initiates a distribution of their account.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Understanding 401(k) Compensation Using an incorrect definition of compensation is on the top ten list of mistakes the IRS sees in voluntary correction filings. Compensation is used to determine various elements of any 401(k) plan including: Participant elective deferrals Employer contributions Whether the plan satisfies certain nondiscrimination requirements Highly compensated employees (HCEs) for testing purposes The IRS permits a plan to use multiple definitions of compensation for different purposes, but there are rules surrounding which definition can be used when. This is why using an incorrect definition of compensation is on the top ten list of mistakes the IRS sees in voluntary correction filings. General Definition of Plan Compensation There are three safe harbor definitions outlined in IRC Section 415(c)(3) that can be used to define “plan compensation” used to allocate participant contributions. W-2 Definition—Wages reported in box 1 of W2&nbsp; PLUS the taxable portion of certain insurance premiums and taxable fringe benefits. The 3401(a) Definition–Wages subject to federal income tax withholding at the source PLUS&nbsp; taxable fringe benefits. The 415 Definition–Wages, salaries, and other amounts received for services rendered such as bonuses, and commissions. It also includes items such as taxable medical or disability benefits and other taxable reimbursements. In some contexts, the plan is required to use this definition for purposes of determining HCEs and the maximum permissible contributions. For all of these definitions, pre-tax elective deferrals are included in reported compensation. In addition, it’s important to note the annual cost of living adjustments on compensation as well as contribution limits by the IRS. These will impact the amount of allowable employer and employee contributions. Compensation for Non-Discrimination Testing As defined in IRC Section 414(s), this definition of compensation is primarily used for various nondiscrimination tests. Safe harbor match or safe harbor nonelective plans, for example, must use this definition to bypass the actual deferral percentage (ADP) and the actual contribution percentage (ACP) test. Each of the three 415(c)(3) definitions also satisfy the 414(s) compensation definition of compensation and can be used for non-discrimination testing. However, a 414(s) definition of compensation can include certain modifications that are not permissible where a 415(c)(3) definition is required. It is not uncommon for the 414(s) definition to exclude fringe benefits such as personal use of a company car or moving expenses. Exclusions of certain forms of pay must be clearly stated and identified in the plan document but may trigger additional nondiscrimination testing (known as compensation ratio testing) to make sure non-highly compensated employees are not disproportionately affected. Additional Compensation Definitions Pre-entry or pre-participation Compensation Plans that have a waiting or eligibility period may elect to exclude compensation earned prior to entering the plan from the compensation definition. This may help alleviate some of the financial burden associated with an employer match or profit-sharing contribution. Although such an exclusion would not trigger any compensation discrimination test, a plan that is deemed “top-heavy” (more than 60% of assets belong to key employees) must calculate any required employer contribution using the full year’s worth of compensation. Post-severance Compensation Post severance compensation are amounts that an employee would have been entitled to receive had they remained employed. It usually includes amounts earned but not yet paid at time of termination (bonuses, commissions), payments for unused leave such as vacations or sick days, and any distributions made from a qualified retirement plan. To be considered as post-severance pay eligible and included in the definition of plan compensation, amounts must be paid before the later of the last day of the plan year in which the employee terminated or two and a half months following the date of termination. Taxable Fringe Benefits Non-cash items of value given to the employee, such as the use of a company car for personal use, must be reported as taxable income. A plan can exclude taxable fringe benefits from its compensation definition and therefore not be subject to the compensation ratio test. Bonuses, Commissions, and Overtime These types of payments are considered plan compensation unless specifically excluded in the plan document. Many employers decide to exclude them because they are not regularly recurring, but should be aware that such exclusions will trigger the compensation ratio test. However, such exclusions must be specifically detailed in the plan document. For example, If a company offers a performance bonus, hiring bonus, and holiday bonus but decides to exclude the hiring and holiday bonuses from the definition of plan compensation, then it must be specific, since “bonus” would be too broad and include all types. Reimbursements and Allowances Allowances (amounts received without required documentation) are taxable, while reimbursements for documented and eligible expenses are not taxable. Allowances are therefore included in the definition of plan compensation while reimbursements are not. An allowance is generally considered a taxable fringe benefit so it is reported and follows certain rules above in regards to compensation definitions. International Compensation Tax implications can easily rise when dealing with international workers and compensation. Employers with foreign affiliates that sponsor non-US retirement plans still may be subject to the US withholding and reporting requirements under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) to combat tax evasions. Companies with employees who either work outside of the U.S. or who work in the U.S. with certain visas will need to carefully review each employee’s status and 401(k) eligibility. Rules and requirements vary by country. However, when 401(k) eligibility is based on citizenship or visa status, work location and compensation currency is not a factor. Define Plan Compensation Carefully Payroll is often a company’s largest expense, so it’s no surprise that companies devote significant time and energy to develop their compensation strategies. However, companies need to be mindful of the implications of their compensation program. Even simple pay structures do not necessarily translate into simple 401(k) plan definitions of compensation. It’s important to review the plan document carefully to be sure compensation definitions used reflect the desires of the company, that the definitions chosen are accurately applied, and that implications are clearly understood.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      401(k) Glossary of Terms Whether you're offering a 401(k) for the first time or need a refresh on important terms, these definitions can help you make sense of industry jargon. 3(16) fiduciary: A fiduciary partner hired by an employer to handle a plan’s day-to-day administrative responsibilities and ensure that the plan remains in compliance with Department of Labor regulations. 3(21) fiduciary: An investment advisor who acts as co-fiduciary to review and make recommendations regarding a plan’s investment lineup. This fiduciary provides guidance but does not have the authority to make investment decisions. 3(38) fiduciary: A codified retirement plan fiduciary that’s responsible for choosing, managing, and overseeing the plan’s investment options. 401(k) administration costs: The expenses involved with the various aspects of running a 401(k) plan. Plan administration includes managing eligibility and enrollment, coordinating contributions, processing distributions and loans, preparing and delivering legally required notices and forms, and more. 401(k) committee charter: A document that describes the 401(k) committee’s responsibilities and authority. 401(k) compensation limit: The maximum amount of compensation that’s eligible to draw on for plan contributions, as determined by the IRS. In 2020, this limit is $285,000. Keep in mind that contributions are also limited by the 401(k) contribution limit, which is $19,500 in 2020 for those under age 50. 401(k) contribution limits: The maximum amount that a participant may contribute to an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, as determined by the IRS. For 2020, the limits are $19,500 for individuals under age 50, and $26,000 for individuals age 50 and older (including $6,500 in catch-up contributions). 401(k) force-out rule: Refers to a plan sponsor’s option to remove a former employee’s assets from the retirement plan. The sponsor has the option to “force out” these assets (into an IRA in the former employee’s name) if the assets are less than $5,000. 401(k) plan: An employer-sponsored retirement savings plan that allows participants to save money on a tax-advantaged basis. 401(k) plan fees: The various fees associated with a plan. These can include fees for investment management, plan administration, fiduciary services, and consulting fees. While some fees are applied at the plan level — that is, deducted from plan assets — others are charged directly to participant accounts. 401(k) plan fee benchmarking: The process of comparing a plan’s fees to those of other plans in similar industries with roughly equal assets and participation rates. This practice can help to determine if a plan’s fees are reasonable per ERISA requirements. 401(k) set-up costs: The expenses involved in establishing a 401(k) plan. These costs cover plan documents, recordkeeping, investment management, participant communication, and other essential aspects of the plan. 401(k) withdrawal: A distribution from a plan account. Because a 401(k) plan is designed to provide income during retirement, a participant generally may not make a withdrawal until age 59 ½ unless he or she terminates or retires; becomes disabled; or qualifies for a hardship withdrawal per IRS rules. Any other withdrawals before age 59 ½ are subject to a 10% penalty as well as regular income tax. 404(a)(5) fee disclosure: A notice issued by a plan sponsor that details information about investment fees. This notice, which is required of all plan sponsors by the Department of Labor, covers initial disclosure for new participants, new fees, and fee changes. 404(c) compliance: Refers to a participant’s (or beneficiary’s) right to choose the specific investments for 401(k) plan assets. Because the participant controls investment decisions, the plan fiduciary is not liable for investment losses. 408(b)(2) fee disclosure: A notice issued by a plan service provider that details the fees charged by the provider (and its affiliates or subcontractors) and reports any possible conflicts of interest. The Department of Labor requires all plan fiduciaries to issue this disclosure. Actual contribution percentage (ACP) test: A required compliance test that compares company matching contributions among highly compensated employees (HCEs) and non-highly compensated employees (NHCEs). Actual deferral percentage (ADP) test: A required compliance test that compares employee deferrals among highly compensated employees (HCEs) and non-highly compensated employees (NHCEs). Annual fee disclosure: A notice issued by a plan sponsor that details the plan’s fees and investments. This disclosure includes plan and individual fees that may be deducted from participant accounts, as well as information about the plan’s investments (performance, expenses, fees, and any applicable trade restrictions). Automated Clearing House (ACH): A banking network used to transfer funds between banks quickly and cost-efficiently. Automatic enrollment (ACA): An option that allows employers to automatically deduct elective deferrals into the plan from an employee’s wages unless the employee actively elects not to contribute or to contribute a different amount. Beneficiary: The person or persons who a participant chooses to receive the assets in a plan account if he or she dies. If the participant is married, the spouse is automatically the beneficiary unless the participant designates a different beneficiary (and signs a written waiver). If the participant is not married, the account will be paid to his or her estate if no beneficiary is on file. Blackout notice: An advance notice of an upcoming blackout period. ERISA rules require plan sponsors to notify participants of a blackout period at least 30 days in advance. Blackout period: A temporary period (three or more business days) during which a 401(k) plan is suspended, usually to accommodate a change in plan administrators. During this period, participants may not change investment options, make contributions or withdrawals, or request loans. Catch-up contributions: Contributions beyond the ordinary contribution limit, which are permitted to help people age 50 and older save more as they approach retirement. In 2022, contribution limits (set by the IRS) are $20,500 on ordinary contributions and $6,500 on catch-up contributions, for a combined limit of $27,000. Compensation: The amount of pay a participant receives from an employer. For purposes of 401(k) contribution calculations, only compensation is considered to be eligible. The plan document defines which form, for example the W-2, is referred to in determining the compensation amount. Constructive receipt: A payroll term that refers to the impending receipt of a paycheck. The paycheck has not yet been fully cleared for deposit in the employee’s bank account, but the employee has access to the funds. Deferrals: Another term for contributions made to a 401(k) account. Defined contribution plan: A tax-deferred retirement plan in which an employee or employer (or both) invest a fixed amount or percentage (of pay) in an account in the employee’s name. Participation in this type of plan is voluntary for the employee. A 401(k) plan is one type of tax-deferred defined contribution plan. Department of Labor (DOL): The federal government department that oversees employer-sponsored retirement plans as well as work-related issues including wages, hours worked, workplace safety, and unemployment and reemployment services. Distributions: A blanket term for any withdrawal from a 401(k) account. A distribution can include a required minimum distribution (RMD), a loan, a hardship withdrawal, a residential loan, or a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO). Docusign: A third-party platform used for exchanging signatures on documents, especially during plan onboarding. EIN: An Employer Identification Number (EIN) is also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number, and is used to identify a business entity. Eligible automatic enrollment arrangement (EACA): An automatic enrollment (ACA) plan that applies a default and uniform deferral percentage to all employees who do not opt out of the plan or provide any specific instructions about deferrals to the plan. Under this arrangement, the employer is required to provide employees with adequate notice about the plan and their rights regarding contributions and withdrawals. ERISA: Refers to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, a federal law that requires individuals and entities that manage a retirement plan (fiduciaries) to follow strict standards of conduct. ERISA rules are designed to protect retirement plan participants and secure their access to benefits in the plan. Excess contributions: The amount of contributions to a plan that exceed the IRS contribution limit. Excess contributions made in any year (and their earnings) may be withdrawn without penalty by the tax filing deadline for that year, and the participant is then required to pay regular taxes on the amount withdrawn. Any excess contributions not withdrawn by the tax deadline are subject to a 6% excise tax every year they remain in the account. Exchange-traded fund (ETF): Passively managed index funds that feature low costs and high liquidity. ETFs make it easy to manage portfolios efficiently and effectively. All of Betterment’s 401(k) investment options are ETFs. Fee disclosure: Information about the various fees related to a 401(k) plan, including plan administration, fiduciary services, and investment management. Fee disclosure deadline: The date by which a plan sponsor must provide plan and investment-related fee disclosure information to participants. The DOL requires you to send your participant fee disclosure notice at least once in any 14-month period without regard to whether the plan operates on a calendar-year or fiscal-year basis. Fidelity bond: Also known as a fiduciary bond, this bond protects the plan from losses due to fraud or dishonesty. Every fiduciary who handles 401(k) plan funds is required to hold a fidelity bond. Fiduciary: An individual or entity that manages a retirement plan and is required to always act in the best interests of employees who save in the plan. In exchange for helping employees build retirement savings, employers and employees receive special tax benefits, as outlined in the Internal Revenue Code. When a company adopts a 401(k) plan for employees, it becomes an ERISA fiduciary and takes on two sets of fiduciary responsibilities: &nbsp; &nbsp; “Named fiduciary” with overall responsibility for the plan, including selecting and monitoring plan investments &nbsp; &nbsp; “Plan administrator” with fiduciary authority and discretion over how the plan is operated Most companies hire one or more outside experts (such as an investment advisor, investment manager, or third-party administrator) to help manage their fiduciary responsibilities. Form 5500: An informational document that a plan sponsor must prepare to disclose the identity of the plan sponsor (including EIN and plan number), characteristics of the plan (including auto-enrollment, matching contributions, profit-sharing, and other information), the numbers of eligible and active employees, plan assets, and fees. The plan sponsor must submit this form annually to the IRS and the Department of Labor, and must provide a summary to plan participants. Smaller plans (less than 100 employees) may instead file Form 5500-SF. Hardship withdrawal: A withdrawal before age 59 ½ intended to address a severe and immediate need (as defined by the IRS). To qualify for a hardship withdrawal, a participant must provide the employer with documentation (such as a medical bill, a rent invoice, funeral expenses) that shows the purpose and amount needed. If the hardship withdrawal is authorized, it must be limited to the amount needed (adjusted for taxes and penalties), may still be subject to early withdrawal penalties, is not eligible for rollover, and may not be repaid to the plan. Highly compensated employee (HCE): An employee who earned at least $125,000 in compensation from the plan sponsor during the previous year (if 2019), or at least $130,000 if the previous year is 2020, or owned more than 5% interest in the plan sponsor’s business at any time during the current or previous year (regardless of compensation). Inception to date (ITD): Refers to contribution amounts since the inception of a participant’s account. Internal Revenue Service (IRS): The U.S. federal agency that’s responsible for the collection of taxes and enforcement of tax laws. Most of the work of the IRS involves income taxes, both corporate and individual. Investment advice (ERISA ruling): The Department of Labor’s final ruling (revised in 2020) on what constitutes investment advice and what activities define the role of a fiduciary. Investment policy statement (IPS): A plan’s unique governing document, which details the characteristics of the plan and assists the plan sponsor in complying with ERISA requirements. The IPS should be written carefully, reviewed regularly, updated as needed, and adhered to closely. Key employee: An employee classification used in top-heavy testing. This is an employee who meets one of the following criteria: &nbsp; &nbsp; Ownership stake greater than 5% &nbsp; &nbsp; Ownership stake greater than 1% and annual compensation greater than $150,000 &nbsp; &nbsp; Officer with annual compensation greater than $200,000 (for 2022) Non-discrimination testing: Tests required by the IRS to ensure that a plan does not favor highly compensated employees (HCEs) over non-highly compensated employees (NHCEs).&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-elective contribution: An employer contribution to an employee’s plan account that’s made regardless of whether the employee makes a contribution. This type of contribution is not deducted from the employee’s paycheck. Non-highly compensated employee (NHCE): An employee who does not meet any of the criteria of a highly compensated employee (HCE). Plan sponsor: An organization that establishes and offers a 401(k) plan for its employees or members. Qualified default investment alternative (QDIA): The default investment for plan participants who don’t make an active investment selection. All 401(k) plans are required to have a QDIA. For Betterment’s 401(k), the QDIA is the Core Portfolio Strategy, and a customized risk level is set for each participant based on their age. Qualified domestic relations order (QDRO): A document that recognizes a spouse’s, former spouse’s, child’s, or dependent’s right to receive benefits from a participant’s retirement plan. Typically approved by a court judge, this document states how an account must be split or reassigned. Plan administrator: An individual or company responsible for the day-to-day responsibilities of 401(k) plan administration. Among the responsibilities of a plan administrator are compliance testing, maintenance of the plan document, and preparation of the Form 5500. Many of these responsibilities may be handled by the plan provider or a third-party administrator (TPA). Plan document: A document that describes a plan’s features and procedures. Specifically, this document identifies the type of plan, how it operates, and how it addresses the company’s unique needs and goals. Professional employer organization (PEO): A firm that provides small to medium-sized businesses with benefits-related and compliance-related services. Profit sharing: A type of defined contribution plan in which a plan sponsor contributes a portion of the company’s quarterly or annual profit to employee retirement accounts. This type of plan is often combined with an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Promissory note: A legal document that lays out the terms of a 401(k) loan or other financial obligation. Qualified non-elective contribution (QNEC): A contribution that a plan is required to make if it’s found to be top-heavy. Required minimum distribution (RMD): Refers to the requirement that an owner of a tax-deferred account begin making plan withdrawals each year starting at age 72. The first withdrawal must be made by April 1 of the year after the participant reaches age 72, and all subsequent annual withdrawals must be made by December 31. Rollover: A retirement account balance that is transferred directly from a previous employer’s qualified plan to the participant’s current plan. Consolidating accounts in this way can make it easier for a participant to manage and track retirement investments, and may also reduce retirement account fees. Roth 401(k) contributions: After-tax plan contributions that do not reduce taxable income. Contributions and their earnings are not taxed upon withdrawal as long as the participant is at least age 59½ and has owned the Roth 401(k) account for at least five years. For 2020, the limits on plan contributions (Traditional, Roth, or a combination of both) are $19,500 for individuals under age 50, and $26,000 for individuals age 50 and older (including $6,500 in catch-up contributions). Roth vs. pre-tax contributions: Pre-tax contributions reduce a participant’s current income, with taxes due when funds are withdrawn (typically in retirement). Alternatively, Roth contributions are deposited into the plan after taxes are deducted, so withdrawals are tax-free. Safe Harbor: A plan design option that provides annual testing exemptions. In exchange, employer contributions on behalf of all employees are required. Saver’s credit: A credit designed to help low- and moderate-income taxpayers further reduce their taxes by saving for retirement. The amount of this credit — 10%, 20%, or 50% of contributions, based on filing status and adjusted gross income — directly reduces the amount of tax owed. Stock option: The opportunity for an employee to purchase shares of an employer’s stock at a specific (often discounted) price for a limited time period. Some companies may offer a stock option as an alternative or a complement to a 401(k) plan. Summary Annual Report (SAR): A summary version of Form 5500, which a plan sponsor is required to provide to participants every year within two months after the Form 5500 deadline – September 30 or December 15 (if there was an extension given for Form 5500 filing). Summary Plan Description (SPD): A comprehensive document that describes in detail how a 401(k) plan works and the benefits it provides. Employers are required to provide an SPD to employees free of charge. Third-party administrator (TPA): An individual or company that may be hired by a 401(k) plan sponsor to help run many day-to-day aspects of a retirement plan. Among the responsibilities of a TPA are compliance testing, generation and maintenance of the plan document, and preparation of Form 5500. Traditional contributions: Pre-tax plan contributions that reduce taxable income. These contributions and their earnings are taxable upon withdrawal, which is typically during retirement.&nbsp; Vesting: Another word for ownership. Participants are always fully vested in the contributions they make. Employer contributions, however, may be subject to a vesting schedule in which participant ownership builds gradually over several years.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Crypto in 401(k) Plans: The Department of Labor’s Guidance The US Department of Labor (DOL) released fresh guidance on cryptocurrency investments for fiduciaries of retirement plans. This article describes the DOL’s guidance and its implications for retirement plans. The US Department of Labor (DOL) issued on March 10th what can be considered a warning to retirement plan fiduciaries that already or will in the future provide cryptocurrency options for 401(k) plan participants. In the wake of President Biden signing an executive order that directs the federal government to develop plans for regulating cryptocurrencies (and digital assets), the DOL published Compliance Assistance Release No. 2022-01, a note that details its perspective on crypto investments and hints that the department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration will conduct investigations of plans that currently offer crypto and related investment options. This article will describe the DOL’s guidance and its implications for retirement plans. What does the DOL note say? The release issued by the DOL primarily serves as a heads up of some of the concerning aspects of crypto investing that should be very carefully considered by plan fiduciaries in order to avoid a breach of their duty to “act solely in the financial interests of plan participants and adhere to an exacting standard of professional care.” The release does not explicitly forbid crypto and related investment options within 401(k)s but instead lists risks associated with such investments. It also conveys that fiduciaries must be able to answer how they “square” providing crypto, if offered, with their fiduciary duties in the context of these risks. The specific risks the DOL identifies are shown below. Risk Description Speculative and Volatile Investments The DOL warns that many crypto investments are subject to extreme volatility, exhibiting sharp swings higher and lower, with the potential that a large drawdown could significantly impair a plan participant’s retirement savings. The Challenge for Plan Participants to Make Informed Investment Decisions The DOL notes that difficulties exist for unsophisticated investors to “separate the facts from the hype” and make informed decisions when it comes to crypto, especially when compared with more traditional investments Custodial and Recordkeeping Concerns The vulnerabilities of much of the current crypto investment infrastructure to hacks and theft is a specific concern to the DOL given the severity of a plan participant losing the entirety of their crypto position Valuation Concerns The difficulty of determining a fundamental value of crypto investments compared to traditional asset classes, along with differences in accounting treatment and reporting among crypto market intermediaries, make up additional concerns to the DOL Evolving Regulatory Environment According to the DOL, “fiduciaries who are considering whether to include a cryptocurrency investment option will have to include in their analysis how regulatory requirements may apply to issuance, investments, trading, or other activities and how those regulatory requirements might affect investments by participants in 401(k) plans” What does this mean for Betterment at Work? 401(k) plans accessed through the Betterment at Work platform currently do not offer crypto investment options. As a 3(38) investment fiduciary, Betterment reviews investments on an ongoing basis to ensure we’ve performed our due diligence in selecting investments suitable for participants' desired investing objectives. As crypto markets and the regulatory environment around retirement plans evolve, Betterment will re-evaluate the suitability of crypto investments within retirement accounts. We will continue to monitor ongoing developments and keep you informed, similar to our efforts to track the DOL’s guidance for Environmental, Social, and Governance-related investing within retirement plans. The above material and content should not be considered to be a recommendation. Investing in digital assets is highly speculative and volatile, and only suitable for investors who are able to bear the risk of potential loss and experience sharp drawdowns.&nbsp; Digital assets are not legal tender and are not backed by the U.S. government. Digital assets are not subject to FDIC insurance or SIPC protections.&nbsp;

    <p class="item-title">What is a 401(k) Plan Audit?</p>

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      What is a 401(k) Plan Audit? If an audit of your 401(k) plan is required, Betterment can help you understand what to expect and how to prepare. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) requires that certain 401(k) plans be audited annually by a qualified independent public accountant subject. The primary purpose of the audit is to ensure that the 401(k) plan is operating in accordance with Department of Labor (DOL) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules and regulations as well as operating consistent with the plan document, and that the plan sponsor is fulfilling their fiduciary duty. A 401(k) plan audit can be fairly broad in scope and usually includes a review of all of the transactions that took place throughout the plan year such as payroll uploads, distributions, corrective actions, and any earnings that were allocated to accounts. It will also include a review of administrative procedures and identify potential areas of concern or opportunities for improvement. When does a 401(k) Plan need an audit? Whether or not your plan requires an audit is determined by the number of participants in your plan at the beginning of the plan year. In this case, participants include not just those employees actively contributing to the plan but also those who were eligible but not participating as well as any terminated participants with a balance. Generally speaking, ERISA requires an audit for any plan that had 100 or more participants (so-called “large plans”) at the beginning of the plan year. However, as shown in the table below, there are exceptions to this general rule, captured in the “80-120 Participant Rule,” to address plans that may have fluctuating participant counts close to that 100 cut-off. Participant Count at Beginning of Plan Year Filing Status on Previous Year’s Form 5500 80-120 Participant Rule 100-120 participants Small Plan Considered a Small Plan (no audit required) until plan has more than 120 participants 80-100 participants Large Plan Considered a Large Plan (audit optional) until plan has fewer than 80 participants It is therefore important to review the plan’s eligible participant count before engaging an auditor, especially if the participant count fluctuates between 80 and 120. If your plan falls under the large plan filer category, engaging a qualified independent auditor as soon as possible after plan year end is advisable. How do I prepare for a 401(k) plan audit? To get started, an auditor will request all plan-related documents, which will likely include: Executed plan document or an executed adoption agreement Any amendments to the plan document Current IRS determination letter (these are attached in the plan document we provide for plan sponsors to execute) Current and historical summary plan description and summaries of material modifications Copy of the plan’s fidelity bond insurance Copy of the most recent compliance test performed Service agreements In general, these documents should be easily accessible and current. That’s why it’s important for plan sponsors to safely keep all applicable plan-related documents, especially if there are changes made. In addition, the auditor will need financial reports of your plan. As part of its 3(16) fiduciary support services, Betterment provides a full audit package which includes: Participant contribution report Plan activity report Payroll records Schedule of plan assets Distributions and/or loans report Fees report Reports regarding investment allocation of plan assets Copies of prior Form 5500 (available on eFAST within the DOL website) Trustee certification/agreement It’s also possible that the auditor may request copies of the committee or board minutes that document considerations and decisions about the plan, including choosing service providers and monitoring plan expenses. What will happen during a 401(k) plan audit? Once the auditor receives all the necessary documents, they will review the plan to gain a solid understanding of the plan’s operations, internal controls and plan activity. The auditor will pick a sample of employees for distributions, loans or rollovers (activity of assets moving out or in of plan) and will request documentation that support such activity. For example, this may include loan applications, distribution paperwork and the image of the check or proof of funds being delivered to the participant. Once the assessments of the samples and financials are complete, the auditor will draft something called an “accountant’s opinion.” The plan sponsor should carefully review this document, which outlines any control deficiencies found during the audit. The auditor will also provide a final financial statement that must be attached to the plan’s Form 5500 before filing with the DOL. Important Deadlines for 401(k) Plan Audits Annual audits should be completed before the Form 5500 filing deadline. Form 5500s are required to be filed by the last day of the seventh month after the plan year ends. For example, if your plan year ends on December 31, your Form 5500 is due on July 31 of the following year. However, you may file an extension with the DOL using Form 5558 to get an additional 2 ½ months to file, pushing the due date to October 15 for calendar year plans. It’s important to meet the required deadline to avoid any DOL penalties. Ready to learn more about how Betterment can help you with plan audits (and so much more)? Let’s talk.

    <p class="item-title">Is Auto-Enroll Right for Your 401(k) Plan?</p>

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Is Auto-Enroll Right for Your 401(k) Plan? Learn the ins and outs of this popular plan feature that streamlines the participant experience. “Maybe when I make more.” “Maybe when I pay off my student loans.” “Maybe when my horoscope tells me it’s time.” When it comes to employees enrolling in their 401(k)s, there’s always a reason why now isn’t the right time. But the fact is the best time to save for retirement is right now, while time and the power of compounding growth are on their side. That’s where 401(k) automatic enrollment—or ‘auto-enroll’ for short—comes in. It gives your employees the gentle nudge they might need to start saving for retirement. Before we dive into auto-enroll and whether it makes sense for your company, let’s take a moment to celebrate your journey toward finding the 401(k) plan that’s right for you! If you’re reading this article, you’ve reached one of the final key considerations of plan design. Another key consideration? That’s whether getting a pass on most compliance testing is worth the employer contribution requirements of a Safe Harbor 401(k) plan. If you go the Safe Harbor route, then your specific flavor of auto-enroll may be called a Qualified Automatic Contribution Arrangement (QACA). We’ll cover QACAs and the two other types of auto-enroll below. How 401(k) auto-enroll works As the name implies, automatic enrollment lets employers automatically deduct elective deferrals from employees’ wages. Simply put, it means your employees don’t have to lift a finger to start saving for retirement. Compare that to the typical enrollment process where employees must go online, make a phone call, or submit paperwork to access their retirement plan. All those little steps take real effort, and employees who are on the fence about enrolling might not be bothered to do it. Before they know it, years have passed, and they’ve missed out on valuable time in the market that they will never get back. Or you can do them a solid and make it all automatic. If you decide to add an automatic enrollment feature to your 401(k) plan, you must notify your employees at least 30 days in advance. After you do, they have three options: Opt out. Employees can opt out of 401(k) plan participation in advance. At Betterment at Work, by the way, we make it simple for employees to do this online. Customize their contribution amount or investments. Instead of enrolling with the default automatic enrollment elections, employees can stay enrolled but choose their own contribution rate. Do nothing for now and enjoy the ride. Here we see the beauty of automatic enrollment. Employees don’t have to do anything to start investing. Once the opt-out timeframe has elapsed, they’ll automatically begin deferring a certain percentage of their pay to their 401(k). Employees are typically informed each year that they can opt out from this enrollment. As you can imagine, option C is a popular choice. Among our clients who use auto-enroll, the employee participation rate is nearly 90 percent. The three types of automatic enrollment Before we go into each, a warning: we’re about to throw even more acronyms at you. If you’re allergic to alphabet soup, prepare accordingly! All three types of auto-enroll require that employees be enrolled at preset contribution rates and have the options to opt out or change their contribution rates. That’s effectively where a Basic Automatic Contribution Arrangement (ACA) begins and ends. Two other varieties add a few more wrinkles on top of that. With an Eligible Automatic Contribution Arrangement (EACA), employees can also request a refund of deferrals within the first 90 days. Employers come to a Qualified Automatic Contribution Arrangement (QACA) by way of a Safe Harbor 401(k) plan. That means they’ve already committed to, among other things, a specific threshold of employer contributions. Safe Harbor plans that include auto-enroll must also steadily increase their employees’ contribution rates each year in what’s often referred to as automatic escalation. We offer auto-escalation at no added expense for all new plans. Here’s how all this shakes out in grid form: &nbsp; Basic Automatic Contribution Arrangement (ACA) Eligible Automatic Contribution Arrangement (EACA) Qualified Automatic Contribution Arrangement (QACA) Employees enrolled at preset contribution rates ✓ ✓ ✓ Employees can opt-out or change contribution rates ✓ ✓ ✓ Employees can request a refund of deferrals within first 90 days &nbsp; ✓ &nbsp; Requires employer contributions (i.e. Safe Harbor) &nbsp; &nbsp; ✓ Requires annual increase in employee contribution rate up to at least 6% (i.e. auto-escalation) &nbsp; &nbsp; ✓ Auto-enrolled, but at how much? With auto-enroll plans, you pick your employees’ default contribution rate. This begs the question: how high should you set it? A default contribution rate of 3 percent used to be the most common, but that changed recently. According to The Plan Sponsor Council of America’s 64th Annual Survey, a 6 percent rate became the most popular in 2020. And if it helps any in your decision-making, our own data shows no evidence of higher default contribution rates leading to higher numbers of opt-outs. In addition to the default contribution rate, you’re also responsible for selecting the default investments for employees’ deferrals. This is what’s referred to as a Qualified Default Investment Alternative (QDIA)—and it can help limit your investment liability. Betterment at Work covers this base for all our 401(k) clients by defaulting employee deferrals into our Core portfolio, which meets QDIA criteria for transferability and safety. One potential downside of auto-enroll Making it easier for people to invest and save for retirement is a good thing. It’s sorta our thing. And if you have a Traditional 401(k) plan, an increased participation rate makes it more likely that your plan will pass the required compliance tests. However, there’s one downside to consider, and it’s mostly a matter of perspective. If you set your default contribution rate relatively low—let’s say less than 6 percent—and don’t actively encourage employees to bump that up as much as they can, they may not get on track to retire by their desired age. Is it better than saving nothing for retirement? Absolutely. But because employees didn’t actively choose the rate, they may not be inclined to increase it on their own. Wondering how to combat this retirement saving inertia? Well, it can be partially addressed by the aforementioned auto-escalation, which steadily increases employees’ contribution rates each year. We also help by offering your employees personalized retirement advice that helps keep them on track. How Betterment at Work makes ‘auto’ even easier As a digital 401(k) plan provider, we can help your employees save for their futures with compelling plan design features like auto-enroll. Our intuitive tech and committed service also lightens your administration load in the process. And let’s not forget about auto-escalation, which we offer at no added cost to new plans. Let us handle the work of monitoring who gets escalated. If your payroll provider is one we offer 360-degree integrations with, we'll even implement the increase ourselves. Last but certainly not least, we guide your employees through their contribution rates, investment options, and more. Even if your employees were auto-enrolled in the plan, they’ll get the encouragement they need to keep moving closer to retirement.

    <p class="item-title">What is a 401(k) Plan Restatement?</p>

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      What is a 401(k) Plan Restatement? Every six years, the IRS requires that all qualified retirement plans be “restated.” Find out what this means for your plan. Every six years, the IRS requires all qualified retirement plans to update their plan documents to reflect recent legislative and regulatory changes - that’s every six years as counted by the IRS, regardless of how long your plan has been active. Some updates are made during the normal course of business through plan amendments, but others require more substantial rewriting of plan documents through a formal process known as a “plan restatement.” This process began on August 1, 2020 and closed on July 31, 2022. Plan restatements are required by the IRS and not optional. Those who do not comply may be subject to significant IRS penalties. If you work with a third party administrator (TPA), they are the ones who handle the plan restatement, and we will coordinate with them when the next cycle begins. What is a plan restatement? A restatement is a complete re-writing of the plan document. It includes voluntary amendments that have been adopted since the last time the document was re-written, along with mandatory amendments to reflect additional legislative and regulatory changes. The latest mandatory restatement period for defined contribution plans is referred to as “Cycle 3” because it was the third required restatement that follows this six-year cycle. Is plan restatement mandatory or voluntary? This plan restatement is mandatory, even if your plan was amended for various reasons in the recent past. Plans that did not meet the July 31, 2022 restatement deadline are subject to penalties, up to and including revocation of tax-favored status. This means contributions might not be deductible and would be immediately included as income to employees. Why do plans have to be restated? Retirement plans are governed by ever-changing laws and regulations imposed by Congress, the IRS, and the Department of Labor (DOL). To remain in compliance and current with those laws and regulations, plan documents must be updated from time to time. Some of these changes may be reflected through plan amendments, but it is impractical for plans to amend their documents for every new law or regulation. What has changed since the last restatement? The deadline for the last mandatory restatement was July 31, 2022. Before that the previous deadline was April 30, 2016, and was based on documents approved by the IRS two years prior and only reflected legislative and regulatory updates through 2010. Since then, there have been a number of regulatory and legislative changes impacting retirement plans such as availability of plan forfeitures to offset certain additional types of company contributions and good faith amendments like the SECURE and CARES Acts. Haven’t we amended our plan to address these changes? Yes. Recognizing that plans would have to continuously update their plans to address changing regulations, the IRS allows for so-called “snap-on” amendments (also known as good faith amendments). However, it is more difficult to interpret a plan document (and therefore operate a plan consistent with the plan document) when there are so many amendments. A restatement cycle requires a full rewrite to incorporate “snap-on” amendments into the body of the document, often in greater detail. How will Betterment help with the plan restatement process? Betterment will draft and deliver the restated plan document to you for review and approval. Once you approve the restated plan document, we will see to it that plan provisions are accurately reflected in our recordkeeping system and provide you with the necessary disclosures for you to deliver to your participants. What does the plan restatement package include? The plan document restatement packages include the following, as applicable, based on your plan’s provisions: Adoption agreement Basic plan document that includes the detailed legal language describing each of the provisions Summary Plan Description (SPD) for distribution to plan participants Administrative policies for participant loans and qualified domestic relations orders (QDROs) Good faith amendments (currently, for the SECURE and CARES Acts) Will this restatement process take a lot of my time? Betterment will ensure that your plan document is properly drafted and delivered to you for execution. However, you have several important roles: Inform Betterment about any organizational changes that may impact your 401(k) plan. Review your restated plan document once you receive it, especially the plan highlight and plan provision (such as eligibility requirements) sections, to be sure they accurately reflect your plan. Distribute the Summary Plan Description (SPD), to be provided to you after you execute the restated plan document, to your plan participants. Is there a fee for this plan restatement? A standard plan restatement will be provided as part of our included compliance services to you. Any additional changes will trigger amendment fees.

    <p class="item-title">Safe Harbor vs. Traditional 401(k) Plan: Which Is Right for You and Your Employees?</p>

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Safe Harbor vs. Traditional 401(k) Plan: Which Is Right for You and Your Employees? Weigh the pros and cons of each carefully before making a decision for your company. 401(k) lingo can seem funny at first glance. There's "MEPs" and "PEPs," “QDIAs” and "Safe Harbors." And don't even get us started on "QACAs." But for now, let's linger on Safe Harbor 401(k) plans. If you’ve concluded that a 401(k) is right for your company, the next decision you face is what kind of 401(k) plan. They come in two primary flavors, with the Safe Harbor variety providing an alternative to the Traditional 401(k) plan. Does the “Safe Harbor” name mean the traditional route is riskier? Not necessarily. There's a host of pros and cons to each plan type. The best fit for your company depends ultimately on your unique situation. Keep reading to try on a Safe Harbor for size. Editor’s note: If you’re reading this during the first half of the year, with eyes on possibly implementing a Safe Harbor plan the following year, time is of the essence! Learn more about Safe Harbor setup deadlines below. Table of contents Safe Harbor 401(k) plans in a nutshell How nondiscrimination testing can trip up small businesses Safe Harbor may make sense for you if … Safe Harbor setup deadlines What Betterment at Work brings to your Safe Harbor 401(k) setup Safe Harbor 401(k) plans in a nutshell Safe Harbor plans offer companies an enticing deal. Contribute to your employees’ 401(k)s, the federal government says, and we’ll give you a free pass on most compliance testing. There's plenty more nuance to them of course (keep reading for that), but this is the key distinction. In Traditional 401(k) plans, employer contributions are allowed but not required—and you face the added burden of annual testing.&nbsp; As with all things in life, Safe Harbor plans come with tradeoffs. Matching your employees’ contributions—or contributing regardless of whether they do through what’s called a nonelective contribution—is great for your employees' financial wellbeing, but it could also increase your overall employee budget by 3% or more depending on the size of your contribution. How nondiscrimination testing can trip up small businesses Federal law requires annual nondiscrimination tests, which help ensure 401(k) plans benefit all employees—not just business owners or highly compensated employees (HCEs). Because the federal government provides significant tax perks through 401(k) plans, it wants to make sure these benefits don’t more heavily favor high earners. The three main nondiscrimination tests are: Actual deferral percentage (ADP) test—Compares the average salary deferrals of HCEs to those of non-highly compensated employees (NHCEs). Actual contribution percentage (ACP) test—Compares the average employer matching contributions received by HCEs and NHCEs. Top-heavy test—Evaluates whether a plan is top-heavy, that is, if the total value of the plan accounts of “key employees” is more than 60% of the value of all plan assets. The IRS defines a key employee as an officer making more than $200,000 in 2022 (indexed), an owner of more than 5% of the business, or an owner of more than 1% of the business who made more than $150,000 during the plan year. In practice, it’s easier for large companies to pass the tests because they have a lot of employees at many different income levels contributing to the plan. If, on the other hand, even just a few HCEs at a small-to-midsize business contribute a lot to the plan, but the lower earners don’t, there’s a chance the 401(k) plan will not pass nondiscrimination testing. You may be wondering: “What happens if my plan fails?” Well, you’ll need to fix the imbalance by either returning a portion of the contributions made by your highly compensated employees or by increasing the contributions of your non-highly compensated employees. If you have to refund contributions, affected employees may fall behind on their retirement savings—and that money may be subject to state and federal taxes! If you don’t correct the issue in a timely manner, there could also be a 10% penalty fee and other serious consequences. Failing these tests, in other words, can be a real pain in the pocketbook. Safe Harbor may make sense for you if … Every company is different, but here’s a list of employer characteristics that tend to align best with the plan type. Your staff count is in the dozens, not hundreds. Not all small businesses are created equal. In general, however, the smaller your staff count, the more likely it is that the 401(k) contributions of high earners could outweigh those of their lower-compensated peers. If that happens under a Traditional 401(k) plan, you’re at a higher risk of failing nondiscrimination testing. Your staff includes a high percentage of part-time and/or seasonal employees. For companies with more fluid staff makeups, the same elevated risk of failing nondiscrimination testing applies. These types of workers are typically allowed to participate in plans yet often don’t contribute, thus negatively impacting testing. Your company has previously failed ADP or ACP compliance tests. This one’s a no-brainer. If Traditional 401(k) plans have given you testing fits in recent years, switching to a Safe Harbor plan could help avoid these costly tripups. Your company’s previous plans have been deemed “top-heavy.” Similar to the above, if you haven’t recently failed an ADP or ACP test as part of a Traditional 401(k) plan, but your plan was deemed “top-heavy,” you may have a higher risk of failing in the future. Your company has consistent and adequate cash flow. Safe Harbor 401(k) plans offer employees a pretty sweet deal. The company kicks in a minimum of 3-4% of their salaries, either contingent on a matching contribution or not (see: nonelective). That money vests immediately, too, which means employees can quit tomorrow and keep it. This commitment to your workforce’s retirement savings is the key cost consideration of Safe Harbor plans. It’s why we typically don’t recommend them for companies with less predictable cash flow year-over-year.&nbsp; You’d rather avoid administrative burdens. Take it from us: even successful compliance testing can be a hassle. And failures? They can lead not only to the aforementioned penalties but to uncomfortable conversations with impacted employees. They’ll need explanations for why their contributions are being returned, and they ultimately may not be able to maximize their 401(k). If you prefer peace-of-mind over these compliance worries, consider the Safe Harbor option. Safe Harbor setup deadlines If you’re strongly considering setting up a Safe Harbor plan or adding a Safe Harbor contribution to your existing plan, here are a few key deadlines you need to know: Starting a new plan For calendar year plans, October 1 is the final deadline for starting a new Safe Harbor 401(k) plan. But don’t cut it too close—you’re required to notify your employees 30 days before the plan starts—and you’ll likely need to talk to your plan provider before that. If we’re fortunate enough to serve in that role for you, that means we’ll need to sign a service agreement by August 1. Adding Safe Harbor to an existing plan If you want to add a Safe Harbor match provision to your current plan, you can include a plan amendment that goes into effect January 1 so long as employees receive notice at least 30 days prior. At Betterment, the deadline for you to request this amendment is October 31.&nbsp; Thanks to the SECURE Act, plans that want to become a nonelective Safe Harbor plan—meaning the employer contributes regardless of whether the employee does—have newfound flexibility. An existing plan can implement a 3% nonelective Safe Harbor provision for the current plan year if amended 30 days before the close of the plan year. Plans that decide to implement a nonelective Safe Harbor contribution of 4% or more have until the end of the following year in which the plan will become a Safe Harbor. Communicating with employees Every year, eligible employees need to be notified about their rights and obligations under your Safe Harbor plan (except for those with nonelective contributions, as noted above). The IRS requires notice be given between 30-90 days before the beginning of the plan year.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Everything You Need to Know about Form 5500 If you’d like to get a general idea of what it takes to file a Form 5500 for a 401(k) plan, here are the top five things you need to know. As you can imagine, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Department of Labor (DOL) like to keep tabs on employee benefit plans to make sure everything is running smoothly and there are no signs of impropriety. One of the ways they do that is with Form 5500. You may be wondering: What is Form 5500? Well, Form 5500—otherwise known as the Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan—discloses details about the financial condition, investments, and operations of the plan. Not only for retirement plans, Form 5500 must be filed by the employer or plan administrator of any pension or welfare benefit plan covered by ERISA, including 401(k) plans, pension plans, medical plans, dental plans, and life insurance plans, among others. If you’re a Betterment client, you don’t need to worry about many of these Form 5500 details because we do the heavy lifting for you. But if you’d like to get a general idea of what it takes to file a Form 5500 for a 401(k) plan, here are the top five things you need to know. 1. There are three different versions of Form 5500—each with its own unique requirements. Betterment drafts a signature-ready Form 5500 on your behalf. But if you were to do it yourself, you would select from one of the following form types based on your plan type: Form 5500-EZ – If you have a one-participant 401(k) plan —also known as a “solo 401(k) plan”—that only covers you (and your spouse if applicable), you can file this form. Have a solo 401(k) plan with less than $250,000 in plan assets as of the last day of the plan year? No need to file a Form 5500-EZ (or any Form 5500 at all). Lucky you! Form 5500-SF– If you have a small 401(k) plan—which is generally defined as a plan that covers fewer than 100 participants on the first day of the plan year—you can file a simplified version of the Form 5500 if it also meets the following requirements: It satisfies the independent audit waiver requirements established by the DOL. It is 100% invested in eligible plan assets—such as mutual funds and variable annuities—with determinable fair values. It doesn’t hold employer securities. Form 5500– If you have a large 401(k) plan—which is generally defined as a plan that covers more than 100 participants—or a small 401(k) plan that doesn’t meet the Form 5500-EZ or Form 5500-SF filing requirements, you must file a long-form Form 5500. Unlike Form 5500-EZ and Form 5500-SF, Form 5500 is not a single-form return. Instead, you must file the form along with specific schedules and attachments, including: Schedule A -- Insurance information Schedule C -- Service provider information Schedule D -- Participating plan information Schedule G -- Financial transaction schedules Schedule H or I -- Financial information (Schedule I for small plan) Schedule R -- Retirement plan information Independent Audit Report Certain forms or attachments may not be required for your plan. Is your plan on the cusp of being a small (or large) plan? If your plan has between 80 and 120 participants on the first day of the plan year, you can benefit from the 80-120 Rule. The rule states that you can file the Form 5500 in the same category (i.e., small or large plan) as the prior year’s return. That’s good news, because it makes it possible for large retirement plans with between 100 and 120 participants to classify themselves as “small plans” and avoid the time and expense of completing the independent audit report. 2. You must file the Form 5500 by a certain due date (or file for an extension). You must file your plan’s Form 5500 by the last business day of the seventh month following the end of the plan year. For example, if your plan year ends on December 31, you should file your Form 5500 by July 31 of the following year to avoid late fees and penalties. If you’re a Betterment client, you’ll receive your signature-ready Form 5500 with ample time to submit it. Plus, we’ll communicate with you frequently to help you meet the filing deadline. But if you need a little extra time, Betterment can file for an extension on your behalf using Form 5558—but you have to do it by the original deadline for the Form 5500. The extension affords you another two and a half months to file your form. (Using the prior example, that would give you until October 15 to get your form in order.) What if you happen to miss the Form 5500 filing deadline? If you miss the filing deadline, you’ll be subject to penalties from both the IRS and the DOL: The IRS penalty for late filing is $250 per day, up to a maximum of $150,000. The DOL penalty for late filing can run up to $2,259 per day, with no maximum. There are also additional penalties for plan sponsors that willfully decline to file. That said, through the DOL’s Delinquent Filer Voluntary Compliance Program (DFVCP), plan sponsors can avoid higher civil penalty assessments by satisfying the program’s requirements. Under this special program, the maximum penalty for a single late Form 5500 is $750 for small 401(k) plans and $2,000 for large 401(k) plans. The DFVCP also includes a “per plan” cap, which limits the penalty to $1,500 for small plans and $4,000 for large plans regardless of the number of late Form 5500s filed at the same time. 3. The Form 5500 filing process is done electronically in most cases. For your ease and convenience, Form 5500 and Form 5500-SF must be filed electronically using the DOL’s EFAST2&nbsp; processing system (there are a few exceptions). EFAST2 is accessible through the agency’s website or via vendors that integrate with the system. To ensure you can file your Form 5500 quickly, accurately, and securely, Betterment facilitates the filing for you. Whether you file electronically or via hard copy, remember to keep a signed copy of your Form 5500 and all of its schedules on file. Once you file Form 5500, your work isn’t quite done. You must also provide your employees with a Summary Annual Report (SAR), which describes the value of your plan’s assets, any administrative costs, and other details from your Form 5500 return. The SAR is due to participants within nine months after the end of the plan year. (If you file an extension for your Form 5500, the SAR deadline also extends to December 15.) For example, if your plan year ends on December 31 and you submitted your Form 5500 by July 31, you would need to deliver the SAR to your plan participants by September 30. While you can provide it as a hard copy or digitally, you’ll need participants’ prior consent to send it digitally. In addition, participants may request a copy of the plan’s full Form 5500 return at any time. As a public document, it’s accessible to anyone via the DOL website. 4. It’s easy to make mistakes on the Form 5500 (but we aim to help you avoid them). As with any bureaucratic form, mistakes are common and may cause issues for your plan or your organization. Mistakes may include: Errors of omission such as forgetting to indicate the number of plan participants Errors of timing such as indicating a plan has been terminated because a resolution has been filed, yet there are still assets in the plan Errors of accuracy involving plan characteristic codes and reconciling financial information Errors of misinterpretation or lack of information such as whether there have been any accidental excess contributions above the federal limits or failure to report any missed contributions or late deposits Want to avoid making errors on your Form 5500? Betterment prepares the form on your behalf, so all you need to do is review, sign, and submit—it’s as simple as that. 5. Betterment drafts a signature-ready Form 5500 for you, including related schedules When it comes to Form 5500, Betterment does nearly all the work for you. Specifically, we: Prepare a signature-ready Form 5500 that has all the necessary information and related schedules Remind you of the submission deadline so you file it on time Guide you on how to file the Form 5500 (it only takes a few clicks) and make sure it’s accepted by the DOL Provide you with an SAR that’s ready for you to distribute to your participants Ready to learn more about how Betterment can help you with your Form 5500 (and so much more)?

    <p class="item-title">Why You Should Have a 401(k) Committee and How to Create One</p>

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Why You Should Have a 401(k) Committee and How to Create One A 401(k) committee can help improve plan management and alleviate your administrative burden. Are you thinking about starting a 401(k) plan or have a plan and are feeling overwhelmed with your current responsibilities? If you answered “yes” to either of these questions, then it might be time to create a 401(k) committee, which can help improve plan management and alleviate your administrative burden.&nbsp; Want to learn more? Read on for answers to frequently asked questions about 401(k) committees. 1. What is a 401(k) committee? A 401(k) committee, composed of several staff members, provides vital oversight of your 401(k) plan. Having a 401(k) committee is not required by the Department of Labor (DOL) or the IRS, but it’s a good fiduciary practice for 401(k) plan sponsors. Not only does it help share the responsibility so one person isn’t unduly burdened, it also provides much-needed checks and balances to help the plan remain in compliance. Specifically, a 401(k) committee handles tasks such as: Assessing 401(k) plan vendors Evaluating participation statistics and employee engagement Reviewing investments, fees, and plan design 2. Who should be on my 401(k) committee? Most importantly, anyone who serves as a plan fiduciary should have a role on the committee because they are held legally responsible for plan decisions. In addition, it’s a good idea to have: Chief Operating Officer and/or Chief Financial Officer Human Resources Director One or more members of senior management One or more plan participants Senior leaders can provide valuable financial insight and oversight; however, it’s also important for plan participants to have representation and input. Wondering how many people to select? It’s typically based on the size of your company – a larger company may wish to have a larger committee. To avoid tie votes, consider selecting an odd number of members. Once you’ve selected your committee members, it’s time to appoint a chairperson to run the meetings and a secretary to document decisions. 3. How do I create a 401(k) committee? The first step in creating a 401(k) committee is to develop a charter. Once documented, the committee charter should be carefully followed. It doesn’t have to be lengthy, but it should include: Committee purpose – Objectives and scope of authority, including who’s responsible for delegating that authority Committee structure – Number and titles of voting and non-voting members, committee roles (e.g., chair, secretary), and procedure for replacing members Committee meeting procedures – Meeting frequency, recurring agenda items, definition of quorum, and voting procedures Committee responsibilities – Review and oversight of vendors; evaluation of plan statistics, design and employee engagement; and appraisal of plan compliance and operations Documentation and reports – Process for recording and distributing meeting minutes and reporting obligations Once you’ve selected your committee members and created a charter, it’s important to train members on their fiduciary duties and impress upon them the importance of acting in the best interest of plan participants and beneficiaries. With a 401(k) committee, your plan may be able to run more smoothly and effectively.

    <p class="item-title">What is a Fidelity Bond?</p>

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      What is a Fidelity Bond? 401(k) plan sponsors are required to purchase a fidelity bond to protect the plan against fraudulent or dishonest acts. Here are answers to common questions. What is a fidelity bond? A fidelity bond is a type of insurance required for those responsible for the day-to-day administration and handling of “funds or other property” of an ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) benefit plan such as a 401(k). The purpose of the bond is to protect the plan from losses due to acts of fraud or dishonesty including theft, embezzlement, larceny, forgery, misappropriation, wrongful abstraction, wrongful conversion and willful misapplication. What are “Funds Or Other Property”? “Funds or other property” refers to 401(k) plan assets. In addition to publicly-traded stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds, all employee and employer contributions are considered “funds,” whether they come in the form of cash, check or property. Who must be covered by a fidelity bond? Under ERISA, it is illegal to receive, disburse, or exercise custody or control of plan funds or property without having a fidelity bond in place. Therefore, anyone who handles or manages 401(k) funds must be covered by a fidelity bond. This includes anyone who has: Physical contact with cash, checks, or similar property Authority to secure physical possession of cash, checks, or similar property through access to a safe deposit box, bank accounts, etc. Authority to transfer plan funds either to oneself or a third party Authority to disburse funds Authority to sign or endorse checks Supervisory or decision-making authority over plan funds This requirement is not just limited to plan managers and plan sponsor employees. Third party service providers that have access to the plan’s funds or exercise decision-making authority over the funds may also require bonding. This includes investment advisors and third-party administrators (TPAs). How much coverage is required? ERISA requires each person handling the plan to be covered for at least 10% of the amount of funds they handle. The coverage can’t be less than $1,000 or more than $500,000, (unless the plan includes employer securities, in which case the maximum amount can be $1,000,000). The exception to the 10% rule applies to ‘non-qualifying plan assets” that may represent more than 5% of the plan’s total assets. Qualifying assets include items held by a financial institution such as a bank, insurance company, mutual funds, etc. Non-qualifying assets are those not held by any financial institution including tangibles such as artwork, collectibles, non-participant loans, property, real estate and limited partnerships. Fidelity bonds have a minimum term of one year. Longer-term bonds will typically include an inflation provision so the value of the bond will increase automatically.&nbsp; The bond amount should be reviewed and updated as the plan assets increase or decrease. Where can I obtain a fidelity bond? The bond must be issued by an underwriter from an insurance company that is listed on the Department of Treasury’s Listings of Approved Sureties. These are companies that have been certified by the Treasury Department. Fidelity bond application During the application process, some plan information may be required. Common items the application will ask is the plan name, address, IRS plan number (ex. 001), and trustee information. Most of the items asked can be found under the administrative information section (usually second to last page) within the Summary Plan Description (SPD). What happens if I don’t cover my plan with a Fidelity Bond? The existence and amount of the plan’s fidelity bond must be reported on your plan’s annual Form 5500 filing. Not having a bond, or not having sufficient coverage based on plan assets, may trigger a Department of Labor audit and may risk the plan’s tax-qualified status. Additionally, the plan fiduciaries may be held personally liable for any losses that may occur from fraudulent or dishonest acts. &nbsp;

    <p class="item-title">Understanding your 401(k) Plan Document</p>

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Understanding your 401(k) Plan Document Betterment will draft your 401(k) plan document, but it’s important that you understand what it includes and that you follow it as written. What exactly is a Plan Document? A 401(k) plan is considered a qualified retirement plan by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and as such, must meet certain requirements to take advantage of significant tax benefits. Every 401(k) retirement plan is required to have a plan document that outlines how the plan is to be operated. The plan document should reflect your organization’s objectives in sponsoring the 401(k) plan, including information such as plan eligibility requirements, contribution formulas, vesting requirements, loan provisions, and distribution requirements. As regulations change or your organization changes plan features and/or rules, the plan document will need to be amended. Your provider will likely draft your plan’s document, but because of your fiduciary duty, it is important that you as plan sponsor review your plan document, understand it, and refer to it if questions arise. Whether you are a small business or a large corporation, failure to operate the plan in a manner consistent with the document as written can result in penalties from the IRS and/or the Department of Labor (DOL). Understanding Your Fiduciary Responsibilities Although any given 401(k) plan may have multiple (and multiple types of) fiduciaries based on specific plan functions, the plan document identifies the plan’s “Named Fiduciary” who holds the ultimate authority over the plan and is responsible for the plan’s operations, administration and investments. Typically the employer as plan sponsor is the Named Fiduciary. The employer is also the “plan administrator” with responsibility for overall plan governance. While certain fiduciary responsibilities may be delegated to third parties, fiduciary responsibility can never be fully eliminated or transferred. All fiduciaries are subject to the five cornerstone rules of ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) when managing the plan’s investments and making decisions regarding plan operations: Acting solely in the interest of plan participants and their beneficiaries and with the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to them; Carrying out their duties prudently; Following the plan documents (unless inconsistent with ERISA); Diversifying plan investments; and Paying only reasonable plan expenses. One of the best ways to demonstrate that you have fulfilled your fiduciary responsibilities is to document your decision-making processes. Many plan sponsors establish a formal 401(k) plan committee to help ensure that decisions are appropriately discussed and documented. Which Type of 401(k) Plan is Best for Your Organization? The plan document will identify the basic plan type: Traditional 401(k) plans provide maximum flexibility with respect to employer contributions and associated vesting schedules&nbsp; (defining when those contributions become owned by the employee). However, these plans are subject to annual nondiscrimination testing to ensure that the plan benefits all employees—not just business owners or highly compensated employees (HCEs). Safe Harbor 401(k) plans are deemed to pass certain nondiscrimination tests but require employers to contribute to the plan on behalf of employees. This mandatory employer contribution must vest immediately—rather than on a graded or cliff vesting schedule. QACA Safe Harbor plans are an exception, which may have up to a two-year cliff vesting schedule. Profit-sharing 401(k) plans include an additional component that allows employers to make more significant contributions to their employee accounts. Besides helping to attract and retain talent, small businesses can find this feature especially helpful In highly profitable years, since it reduces taxable income. There is no one plan type that is better than another, but this flexibility allows you to determine which type makes the most sense for your organization. Eligibility Requirements to Meet Your Needs Although the IRS mandates that employees age 21 or older with at least 1 year of service are eligible&nbsp; to make employee deferrals, employers do have considerable flexibility in setting 401(k) plan eligibility: Age -- employers often choose to adopt a minimum age of 18. Service -- employers can establish requirements on elapsed time or hours. Entry date -- employers may allow employees to participate in the plan immediately upon hiring but often require some waiting period. For example, employees may have to wait until the first of the month or quarter following their hire date. This flexibility allows employers to adopt eligibility requirements appropriate to their business needs. For instance, a company with high turnover or lots of seasonal workers may institute a waiting period to reduce the number of small balance accounts and the associated administrative costs. Automatic Enrollment may be the Way to Go Enrollment in a 401(k) plan can either be voluntary or automatic. As retirement savings has become ever more essential for workers, employers are increasingly choosing to adopt automatic enrollment, whereby a set percentage is automatically deferred from employee paychecks and contributed to the plan, unless an employee explicitly elects to “opt out” or not contribute. The benefit of automatic enrollment is that human inertia means most employees take no action and start saving for their future. As of September 2022, only 13% of participants who were auto-enrolled opted out per Betterment’s internal analysis.&nbsp; Employee Contribution Flexibility Provides Valuable Flexibility The plan document will specify the types of contributions (or “elective deferrals”) that eligible employees can make to the plan via payroll deduction. Typically these will be either pre-tax contributions or Roth (made with after-tax dollars) contributions. Allowing plan participants to decide when to pay the taxes on their contributions can provide meaningful flexibility and tax diversification benefits. Elective deferrals are often expressed as either a flat dollar amount or as a percentage of compensation. Employee contribution limits are determined each year by the IRS. The plan document must specify whether the plan will allow catch-up contributions for those age 50 and older. Able and/or Willing to Contribute to Employee Accounts? The plan document will also include provisions regarding employer contributions, which can be made on either a matching or non-matching basis. Matching contributions are often used to incentivize employees to participate in the plan. For example, an employer may match 50% of every $1 an employee contributes, up to a maximum of 6% of compensation. For traditional 401(k) plans, matching contributions can be discretionary so that the employer can determine not only how much to contribute in any given year but whether or not to contribute at all. As stated above, matching employer contributions are required for Safe Harbor 401(k) plans. The plan document may also permit the employer to make contributions other than matching contributions. These so-called “nonelective” contributions would be made on behalf of all employees who are considered plan participants, regardless of whether they are actively contributing. Vesting Schedules and Employee Retention Vesting simply means ownership. Employees own, or are fully vested, in their own contributions at all times. Employers with traditional 401(k) plans, however, often impose a vesting schedule on company contributions to encourage employee retention. Although there are a wide variety of approaches to vesting, one of the most common is to use a graded vesting schedule. For instance, an employee would vest in the employer contribution at a rate of 25% each year and be 100% vested after 4 years. Employer contributions as part of Safe Harbor 401(k) plans are vested immediately, aside from QACA Safe Harbor plans.

    <p class="item-title">Thinking of Changing 401(k) Providers? Here’s What to Consider</p>

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Thinking of Changing 401(k) Providers? Here’s What to Consider If you’re considering changing 401(k) providers, be sure to spend some time assessing your current situation and prioritizing your criteria. If you’re reading this, you may have reservations about your current 401(k) provider—and that’s okay. It’s not unusual for companies to change their 401(k) provider from time to time or feel out potential alternatives. We’d argue it’s even best practice to periodically take stock of your current situation. You want to feel confident your plan is keeping up with industry best practices and that you and your employees are getting good value for your money. So how do you go about it? In this guide, we’ll walk you through: Four criteria to consider before switching providers How to switch providers, step-by-step What to expect when switching your plan to Betterment at Work Four criteria to consider before switching 401(k) providers Let’s start with a friendly reminder: because choosing a 401(k) provider is a fiduciary act, you should carefully evaluate your options and clearly document the process. Even just a few criteria can go a long way in that pursuit. Taken altogether, they can give you a better sense of whether you should make a move or stay put. So if you haven’t read through your current agreement recently, now’s a good time to re-familiarize yourself and see how those terms stack up with the following criteria. It isn’t an exhaustive list by any means, but if you find they fall short in these criteria, it may be time to assess other options. Cost 401(k) plan fees can be complicated, but we’ll simplify things a little by sorting them into three categories: Plan administration fees Plan administration fees are (in most cases) paid by you, the plan sponsor, and cover things like plan setup, recordkeeping, auditing, compliance, support, legal, and trustee services.&nbsp; Investment fees Investment fees are typically paid by plan participants and are often assessed as a percentage of assets under management. They come in two forms: - Fund fees, aka “expense ratios,” charged by the individual funds or investments themselves. - Advisory fees charged by the provider for portfolio construction and the ongoing management of plan assets. Individual service fees If participants elect certain services, such as taking out a 401(k) loan, they may be assessed individual fees for each service. Plan providers are required to disclose costs such as these—as well as one-off fees relating to events such as amendments and terminations—in fee disclosure documents.&nbsp; All in all, fees can vary greatly from company to company, especially depending on the amount of assets in their plans. Larger plans, thanks to their purchasing power and economies of scale, tend to pay less. While comparisons can be hard to come by, one source is the 401k Averages Book. You’ll just need to pay—ahem—a fee to access their data. Support Support can encompass any number of areas, but it really boils down to this: do you and your employees feel forgotten and left to fend for yourselves, or do you feel the comforting and consistent presence of a trusted partner? The quality of service received by both groups—both you the plan sponsor and the plan participants—matters equally, so be sure to ask your employees about their experience. How easy is the provider’s user interface for them to navigate? Was it simple to set up their account and get started toward their goals? What kind of education are they being served along the way? One indicator of good participant support is when a majority of them are making contributions at healthy rates. From the plan sponsor’s perspective, many of the same questions regarding setup and day-to-day operations apply. Crucially, however, your support should extend to matters of compliance and auditing: Are the documents provided for your review and approval accurate and timely? When you’ve needed to consult on compliance issues, do you receive clear and helpful answers to your questions? Does the provider deliver a comprehensive audit package to you if you need it and collaborate well with your auditor? There’s also the question of payroll integration. Does your current 401(k) provider support it? How smoothly have things been running? Betterment at Work supports both 360o integration, where your payroll system and 401(k) system can send information back and forth, and 180o integration, where the data flows only one way, from your payroll system to the 401(k) system. If payroll integration is something you’re looking for in a new provider, be sure you understand these different levels of integration and which responsibilities you may retain. Investment Options For starters, it’s worth thinking about the investment philosophy of your current provider and whether that approach aligns with the needs of your employee demographic. What sort of investment options and guidance do they provide your employees? Some providers could offer a handful of target date funds and mutual funds then call it a day. This could be less than ideal for several reasons. For one, target date funds are essentially a rigid, one-size-fits-all solution to the problem of 401(k) investors not adjusting their risk exposure as they near retirement. If, however, an employee wants to customize their allocation according to their risk appetite, or if they plan to work past their retirement date, the target date fund may no longer be suitable for them. They’re left to figure out for themselves how and where to invest. Contrast that with Betterment at Work, where our portfolios can be customized based on a participant’s planned retirement date or their appetite for risk in general. Mutual funds, meanwhile, tend to cost more, anywhere from 2.5x to 5x more on average, and perform worse over the long run. This is why Betterment builds and manages its portfolios with lower-cost exchange traded funds (ETFs). All things considered, our investment options are designed for the long-term to help your employees reach their retirement goals.&nbsp; Wherever your plan’s investment options land, you still have an obligation as a fiduciary to operate the plan for the benefit of your employees. This means it’s not about what you or a handful of managers want from an investment perspective, but what serves the best interests of the majority of your employees.&nbsp; Finally, one important consideration is whether the plan provider is an ERISA 3(38) investment fiduciary like Betterment. This alleviates the burden of you, the plan sponsor, having to select and monitor the plan investments yourself. Instead, the plan provider assumes the responsibility for investment decisions, saving you time and stress. We’ll touch on other forms of fiduciary responsibility in the section below. Plan design Changing providers doesn’t mean you’re terminating your 401(k) plan and starting from scratch. That has legal ramifications, including not being able to establish another 401(k) plan for at least a year. It does present an opportunity to consider changing the design of your plan, like adding a Safe Harbor match provision. There are also features like auto-enroll and auto-escalation, which Betterment at Work offers at no additional cost. Now’s also a good time to know what level of fiduciary responsibility your current provider assumes and whether you’d want a new provider to have that same level of responsibility, take on more, or whether you’re comfortable taking on more fiduciary responsibility yourself. In terms of investments, the provider may serve as the ERISA 3(21) fiduciary, which provides only investment recommendations, or the aforementioned ERISA 3(38) fiduciary (like Betterment at Work), which provides discretionary investment management. Or they may not be a fiduciary at all. In terms of administration, the provider may or may not provide ERISA 3(16) services (Betterment at Work does). There can be a wide range of functions that fall within that, so refer to your agreement to be sure you know exactly which services they are responsible for and which by default, fall to you as plan administrator. How to switch providers, step-by-step So you’ve done and documented your research and reached the conclusion that it’s time to make a change. What next? Better understanding the mechanics of a move can help you manage expectations internally and create reasonable timelines. Typically, changing providers takes at least 90 days, with coordination and testing needed between both providers to reconcile all records and ensure accurate and timely transfer of plan assets. Once you’ve identified your chosen successor provider and executed a services agreement with them, high-level steps include: Notify your current provider of your decision. You may hear them refer to this as a “deconversion” process. Establish a timeline for asset transfer and a go-live date with the new provider. Review your current plan document with the new provider. This will give you the chance to discuss any potential plan design changes. Be sure to raise any challenges you’ve faced with your current plan design as well as any organizational developments (planned expansion, layoffs, etc) that may impact your plan. Set up the investments. If your new provider is a 3(38) investment fiduciary, you’ll likely have nothing to do here since the provider has discretionary investment responsibilities and will make all decisions with respect to fund selection and monitoring. If your new provider is NOT a 3(38) investment fiduciary, then you’ll have the responsibility for selecting funds for your plan. The plan provider will likely have a menu of options for you to choose from. However, this is an important fiduciary responsibility, and if you (or others at your organization) do not feel qualified to make these decisions, then you should consider hiring an investment expert. Review and approve revised plan documents. Communicate the change to employees (including required legal notices), with information on how to set up and access their account with the new provider. Wait through the blackout period. The blackout period is a span of time—anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks depending on your old provider—when employees can’t make contributions, change investments, make transfers, or take loans or distributions. Participants’ accounts are typically still invested up until the old provider liquidates them and sends them to the new provider. From there, they’re re-invested by the new provider. Outstanding employee loans are also transferred from the old provider to the new provider. Confirm the transfer of assets and allocation of plan assets to participant accounts at your new provider. What to expect when switching your plan to Betterment at Work As you can see from the steps above, switching 401(k) plan providers isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. But that doesn’t mean some providers don’t make it easier than others. We pride ourselves on streamlining the process for new clients in a number of ways: As a 3(38) fiduciary, we handle all investment decisions for you. That’s one less thing to worry about when serving the interests of your employees. We also create accounts for eligible employees and participants, saving them the hassle. You can track the entire onboarding process, meanwhile, in your employer dashboard. Regardless of whether you end up making a switch, we hope the criteria above helped you take better stock of your current 401(k) offering. Before, during, or after that decision, we’re here to help.

    <p class="item-title">The Case for Including ETFs in Your 401(k) Plan</p>

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      The Case for Including ETFs in Your 401(k) Plan At Betterment, we firmly believe Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are better for 401(k) plan participants. Wondering if ETFs may be appropriate for your plan? Mutual funds dominate the retirement investment landscape, but in recent years, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become increasingly popular—and for good reason. They are cost-effective, highly flexible, and technologically sophisticated. And at Betterment, we firmly believe they’re also better for 401(k) plan participants. Wondering if ETFs may be appropriate for your 401(k) plan? Read on. What’s the difference between mutual funds and ETFs? Let’s start with what ETFs and mutual funds have in common. Both consist of a mix of many different assets, which helps investors diversify their portfolios. However, they have three key differences: ETFs can be traded like stocks. However, mutual funds may only be purchased at the end of each trading day based on a calculated price. Mutual funds are either actively managed by a fund manager who decides how to allocate assets or passively managed by tracking a specific market index (such as the S&amp;P 500). However, ETFs are usually passively managed. Mutual funds tend to have higher fees and higher expense ratios than ETFs. Why do mutual funds cost so much more than ETFs? Many mutual funds are actively managed—requiring in-depth analysis and research—which drives the costs up. However, while active managers claim to outperform popular benchmarks, research conclusively shows that they rarely succeed in doing so. See what we mean. Mutual fund providers generate revenues from both stated management fees, as well as less direct forms of compensation, for example: Revenue sharing agreements—These agreements among 401(k) plan providers and mutual fund companies include: 12(b)-1 fees, which are disclosed in a fund’s expense ratios and are annual distribution or marketing fees Sub Transfer Agent (Sub-TA) fees for maintaining records of a mutual fund’s shareholders Internal fund trading expenses—The buying and selling of internal, underlying assets in a mutual fund are another cost to investors. However, unlike the conspicuous fees in a fund’s expense ratio, these brokerage expenses are not disclosed and actual amounts may never be known. Instead, the costs of trading underlying shares are simply paid out of the mutual fund’s assets, which results in overall lower returns for investors. Soft-dollar arrangements—These commission arrangements, sometimes called excess commissions, exacerbate the problem of hidden expenses because the mutual fund manager engages a broker-dealer to do more than just execute trades for the fund. These services could include nearly anything—securities research, hardware, or even an accounting firm’s conference hotel costs! All of these costs mean that mutual funds are usually more expensive than ETFs. These higher expenses come out of investors’ pockets. That helps to explain why a majority of actively managed funds lag the net performance of passively managed funds, which lag the net performance of ETFs with the same investment objective over nearly every time period. Want to know more about mutual funds’ hidden fees? What else didn’t I realize about mutual funds? Often, there are conflicts of interest with mutual funds. The 401(k) market is largely dominated by players who are incentivized to offer certain funds: Some service providers are, at their core, mutual fund companies. And therefore, some investment advisors are incentivized to promote certain funds. This means that the fund family providing 401(k) services and the advisor who sells the plans may have a conflict of interest. As noted in a report by the Center for Retirement Research (CRC), 76% of plans had trustees affiliated with mutual fund management companies, which creates a conflict of interest. Why is it unusual to see ETFs in 401(k)s? Mutual funds continue to make up the majority of assets in 401(k) plans for various reasons, not despite these hidden fees and conflicts of interest, but because of them. Plans are often sold through distribution partners, which can include brokers, advisors, recordkeepers or third-party administrators. The fees embedded in mutual funds help offset expenses and facilitate payment of every party involved in the sale. However, it’s challenging for employers and employees because the fees aren’t easy to understand even with the mandated disclosure requirements. Another reason why it’s unusual to see ETFs in a 401(k) is existing technology limitations. Most 401(k) recordkeeping systems were built decades ago and designed to handle once-per-day trading, not intra-day trading (the way ETFs are traded)—so these systems can’t handle ETFs on the platform (at all). However, times are changing. ETFs are gaining traction in the general marketplace and companies like Betterment are leading the way by offering ETFs. Why should I consider ETFs for our company’s 401(k)? Simply put, ETFs are the next level in access, flexibility, and cost. Here’s a look at key attributes that may make ETFs right for your 401(k) plan: Low cost—As we’ve described, ETFs generally cost far less than mutual funds. Diversified—Most exchange-traded funds—and all ETFs used by Betterment—are considered a form of mutual fund under the&nbsp;Investment Company Act of 1940, which means they have explicit diversification requirements.&nbsp;Appropriate diversification ensures that you’re not overly exposed to individual stocks, bonds, sectors, or countries—which may mean better returns in the long run. Flexible—ETFs are extremely versatile. They can be accessed by anyone with a brokerage account and just enough money to buy at least one share (and sometimes less—at Betterment we trade&nbsp;fractional shares, allowing our customers to diversify as little as $10 across a portfolio of 12 ETFs.) Sophisticated—ETFs take advantage of decades of technological advances in buying, selling, and pricing securities. Learn more about these five attributes now. What’s even better than ETFs? At Betterment, we believe that a portfolio of ETFs in conjunction with personalized, unbiased advice is the ideal solution for today’s retirement savers. Our retirement advice adapts to your employees’ desired retirement timeline and can be customized if they’re more conservative or aggressive investors. Not only that, we also link employees’ outside investments, savings accounts, IRAs—even spousal/partner assets—to create a real-time snapshot of their finances. It makes saving for retirement (and any other short- or long-term goals) even easier. You may be wondering: What about target-date funds? Well, target-date funds are still popular, but financial advice has progressed far beyond using one data point—employees’ desired retirement age—to determine their investing strategy. Here’s how: Target-date funds are only in five-year increments (for example, 2045 Fund or 2050 Fund). Betterment can tailor our advice to the exact year your employees want to retire. Target-date funds ignore how much employees have saved. At Betterment, we can tell your employees if they‘re on or off track, factoring in all of their retirement savings, Social Security, pensions, and more. Target-date funds only contain that company’s underlying investments (for example, Vanguard target-date funds only have Vanguard investments). No single company is the best at every type of investment, so don’t limit your employees’ retirement to just one company’s investments. Find out why target-date funds are out of date. Smart, savvy advice for today’s retirement savers Betterment’s automated advice engine and portfolio selection are guided by a human team of experts on our investment committee. They are free to select the best investments we can find, regardless of who makes them. Now what? You may be thinking: it’s time to have a heart-to-heart with your 401(k) provider or plan’s investment advisor. If so, here’s a list of questions to ask: Do you offer ETFs? If not, why not? What are the fees associated with our funds? Are there revenue sharing agreements in place? Are there any soft-dollar arrangements we should be aware of? Are you incentivized to offer certain funds? Are there any conflicts of interests that we should be aware of?

      Share the Wealth: Everything you need to know about profit sharing 401(k) plans In addition to bonuses, raises, and extra perks, many employers elect to add profit sharing to their 401(k) plan. Read on for answers to frequently asked questions. Has your company had a successful year? A great way to motivate employees to keep up the good work is by sharing the wealth. In addition to bonuses, raises, and extra perks, many employers elect to add profit sharing to their 401(k) plan. Wondering if it might be right for your business? Read on for answers to frequently asked questions about profit sharing 401(k) plans. What is profit sharing? Let’s start with the basics. Profit sharing is a way for you to give extra money to your staff. While you could make direct payments to your employees, it’s very common to combine profit sharing with an employer-sponsored retirement plan. That way, you reward your employees—and help them save for a brighter future. What is a profit sharing plan? A profit sharing plan is a type of defined contribution plan that allows you to help your employees save for retirement. With this type of plan, you make “nonelective contributions” to your employees’ retirement accounts. This means that each year, you can decide how much cash (or company stock, if applicable) to contribute—or whether you want to contribute at all. It’s important to note that the name “profit sharing” comes from a time when these plans were actually tied to the company’s profits. Nowadays, companies have the freedom to contribute what they want, and they don’t have to tie their contributions to the company’s annual profit (or loss). In a pure profit sharing plan, employees do not make their own contributions. However, most companies offer a profit sharing plan in conjunction with a 401(k) plan. What is a profit sharing 401(k) plan? A 401(k) with profit sharing enables both you and your employees to contribute to the plan. Here’s how it works: &nbsp;The 401(k) plan allows employees to make their own salary deferrals—up to $19,500 per year (or $26,000 for employees over age 50) The profit sharing component allows employers to contribute up to $58,000 per employee (or $64,500 for employees over age 50), or 100% of their salary, whichever is lower. However, this limit includes employees’ 401(k) contributions, so typically, employers calculate their contributions keeping the $19,500 401(k) employee salary deferral maximum in mind. &nbsp;After the end of the year, employers can make their pre-tax profit sharing contribution, as a percentage of each employee’s salary or as a fixed dollar amount Employers determine employee eligibility, set the vesting schedule for the profit sharing contributions, and decide whether employees can select their own investments (or not) What’s the difference between profit sharing and an employer match? Profit sharing and employer matching contributions seem similar, but they’re actually quite different: Employer match—Employer contributions that are tied to employee savings up to a certain percentage of their salary (for example, 50 cents of every dollar saved up to 6% of pay) Profit sharing—An employer has the flexibility to choose how much money—if any at all—to contribute to employees’ accounts each year; the amount is not tied to how much employees save. What kinds of profit sharing plans are there? There are three &nbsp;main types of profit sharing plans: &nbsp;Pro-rata plan—Every plan participant receives employer contributions at the same rate. For example, every employee receives the equivalent of 5% of their salary or every employee receives a flat dollar amount such as $1,000. Why is it good? It’s simple and rewarding. New comparability profit sharing plan (otherwise known as “cross-tested plans”)—Employees are placed into separate benefit groups that receive different profit sharing amounts. For example, business owners (or other highly compensated employees) are in one group that receives the maximum contribution and all other employees are in another group and receive a lower amount. Why is it good? It offers owners the most flexibility. Age-weighted profit sharing plan—Employees are given profit sharing contributions based on their retirement age. That is, the older the employee, the higher the contribution. Why is it good? It helps with employee retention. How do I figure out our company’s profit sharing contribution? First, consider which type of profit sharing plan you’ll be using—pro-rata, new comparability, or age-weighted. Next, take a look at your company’s profits, business outlook, and other financial factors. Keep in mind that: There is no set amount that you have to contribute You don’t need to make contributions Even though it’s called “profit sharing,” you don’t need to show profits on your books to make contributions The IRS notes that the “comp-to-comp” or pro-rata method is one of the most common ways to determine each participant’s allocation. Using this method, you calculate the sum of all of your employees’ compensation (the “total comp”). To determine the profit sharing allocation, divide the profit sharing pool by the total comp. You then multiply this percentage by each employee’s salary. Here’s an example of how it works: Your profit sharing pool is $15,000, and the combined compensation of your three eligible employees is $180,000. Therefore, each employee would receive a contribution equal to 8.3% of their salary. Employee Salary Calculation Profit sharing contribution Taylor $40,000 $15,000 x 8.3% $3,333 Robert $60,000 $15,000 x 8.3% $5,000 Lindsay $80,000 $15,000 x 8.3% $6,667 What are the key benefits of profit sharing for employers? It’s easy to see why profit sharing helps employees, but you may be wondering how it helps your small business. Consider these key benefits: Provide a valuable benefit (while controlling costs)—With employer matching contributions, your costs can dramatically rise if you onboard several new employees. However, with profit sharing, the amount you contribute is entirely up to you. Business is doing well? Contribute more to share the wealth. Business hits a rough spot? Contribute less (or even skip a year). Attract and retain top talent—Profit sharing is a generous perk when recruiting new employees. Plus, you can tweak your profit sharing rules to aid in retention. For example, some employers may elect to have a graded or cliff profit sharing contribution vesting schedule to motivate employees to continue working for their company. Rack up the tax deductions—Profit sharing contributions are tax deductible and not subject to payroll (e.g., FICA) taxes! So if you’re looking to lower your taxable income in a profitable year, your profit sharing plan can help you make the highest possible contribution (and get the highest possible tax write-off). Motivate employees to greater success—Employees who know they’ll receive financial rewards when their company does well are more likely to perform at a higher level. Companies may even link profit sharing to performance goals to motivate employees. Employees love profit sharing It’s no surprise that employees love profit sharing. Retirement is one of the biggest expenses employees face—and it means a lot to know that their employer is contributing to their future. Get a profit sharing 401(k) plan your employees will love. What are the nuts and bolts of profit sharing 401(k) plans? The IRS clearly defines the rules for contributions, tax deduction limits, and other aspects of profit sharing plans. Here’s a quick overview of the most important regulations: Contribution limits—Employers can only contribute up to 100% of an employee’s compensation, or up to $57,000 per employee (or $63,500 for employees over the age of 50), whichever is lower. Calculation rules—When calculating an employee’s profit sharing contribution, only compensation up to $285,000 per year can be considered. Tax deduction limits—Employers can deduct profit sharing contributions from their taxes up to maximum contribution limits (generally, up to 25% of the total eligible compensation across eligible employees). Disclosure—Like with a typical 401(k) plan, employers must issue disclosures and file the appropriate forms with the Department of Labor and IRS. Deadline—Employers must make their contributions to the profit sharing plan by their company tax filing deadline (unless they file an extension). Are there any downsides to offering a profit sharing plan? Contribution rate flexibility is one of the greatest benefits of a profit sharing 401(k) plan—but it could also be one of its greatest downsides. If business is down one year and employees get a lower profit sharing contribution than they expect, it could have a detrimental impact on morale. However, for many companies, the advantages of a profit sharing 401(k) plan outweigh this risk. How do I set up a profit sharing 401(k) plan? If you already have a 401(k) plan, it’s as easy as adding an amendment to your plan document. However, you’ll want to take the time to think through how your profit sharing plan supports your company’s goals. Betterment can help. At Betterment, we handle everything from nondiscrimination testing to plan design consulting to ensure your profit sharing 401(k) plan is fully optimized. And as a 3(38) fiduciary, we take full responsibility for selecting and monitoring your investments so you can focus on running your business—not managing your retirement plan.

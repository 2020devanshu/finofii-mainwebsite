      Introducing the RIA Tech Suite Sep 29, 2022 12:00:00 AM The RIA Tech Suite brings together complementary technology platforms to help automate critical back-office tasks for advisors. The RIA Tech Suite brings together complementary technology platforms to help automate critical back-office tasks for advisors. Along with RIA in a Box®, RightCapital, and Wealthbox, Betterment for Advisors is excited to introduce the RIA Tech Suite: a set of services and tools that advisors can use to help automate and streamline back-office tasks.&nbsp; Why should firms utilize the RIA Tech Suite? Together, these intuitive and complementary tech tools can streamline everyday practice management, giving you more time to acquire new business and to provide a better experience for your current clients. Additionally, the RIA Tech Suite includes discounted pricing for firms that adopt two or more of the services—a discount that could save the average RIA firm up to $3,100 in their first year.1 Here are the tools available on the RIA Tech Suite: Betterment for Advisors - A leading digital-first wealth management platform that leverages smart-tax technology. RIA in a Box® - Compliance, cybersecurity, and operational software for investment advisors. RightCapital - Wealth planning software that makes planning easier and more powerful for advisors and their clients. Wealthbox - A leading CRM software application that helps advisors manage their clients and collaborate with their team. The RIA Tech Suite can foster growth for tech-centric firms that are focused on efficient client service and expanding their books of business.&nbsp; “Our goal at Betterment for Advisors is to empower advisors to grow their businesses and build deeper client relationships,” writes Jon Mauney, General Manager of Betterment for Advisors. “The four companies that are part of the RIA Tech Suite all share this objective with a common approach to their services: providing beautifully designed, easy-to-use, and powerful tools for advisors and their clients.” The RIA Tech Suite is now available to all registered investment advisors. You can learn more and sign up for this offering by visiting https://riatechsuite.com. &nbsp; &nbsp; Betterment for Advisors is a member of the coalition known as RIA Tech Suite alongside three other platforms: RIA in a Box, RightCapital, and Wealthbox. The four companies are offering advisors who become new clients of two or more members of RIA Tech Suite, discounts on services provided by such participating companies. Betterment and aforementioned firms are not under common ownership or otherwise related entities, and no compensation has been exchanged between the members of RIA Tech Suite for the purposes of entering into this coalition. Terms subject to change. This offering is for investment professionals only and is not intended for use by private investors.&nbsp; ¹ 3100 USD is an estimate of the maximum amount saved on the annual cost for combined subscription fees across all four services noted in this article. Calculation assumes the average of weighted monthly rates offered across all four services plus their onboarding fees, which are subject to change at each service providers’ discretion, and then applies a 15% discount from each. The discount rate of 15% per company is activated upon engagement of a minimum of two companies. Actual dollar amount saved may vary; Betterment makes no guarantee of the specific dollar amount your firm could save.

    <p class="item-title">More Billing Flexibility For Advisors</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      More Billing Flexibility For Advisors Sep 29, 2022 12:00:00 AM As part of our mission to make it easy for advisors to manage their practices, we offer a variety of billing plans to provide advisors more flexibility for charging clients. Our three Billing Plans allow advisors to set fee structures that fit the needs of both their advisory firm and their clients. Under each plan, advisory fees will accrue daily and be assessed on a monthly or quarterly basis as set by the firm. Advisors who have admin privileges can create new Billing Plans and set the default Plan for their firm, which will be used for new households moving forward. Any advisor can choose from the list of available Billing Plans—which are created by admin advisors—and assign any Plan to their clients. Below, we’ll outline how each Billing Plan works and give examples of how fees might look for households of varying asset ownership levels. Asset-Based Billing Fixed Fee Billing Tiered Billing Note that regardless of which Billing Plan is chosen, each advised client pays a percentage fee directly to Betterment for portfolio management. The fees represented in each Billing Plan below are additional fees (on top of Betterment's wrap fee) that are collected by Betterment on behalf of the advisor and sent to each advisory firm on a monthly or quarterly basis. Asset-Based Billing In the past, the only billing option for advisors was to charge basis points (bps) on a client’s assets, regardless of account balance. We’ll still be offering this asset-based billing option, however, it must now be applied to a total household rather than separately across a household’s legal accounts. As a reminder, legal accounts include individual taxable, joint taxable, trusts, and each type of IRA. A household consists of all legal accounts owned by one person, as well as all the accounts owned by anyone that person shares a joint account or trust with. Households can also be created by explicitly associating two or more people. Example of Asset-Based Billing Plan at 50 bps &nbsp; Balance Annual Fee Approx. Quarterly Fee Household 1 $50,000 $250 $62.50 Household 2 $500,000 $2,500 $625 Household 3 $3,000,000 $15,000 $3,750 &nbsp; Fixed Fee Billing Advisors can set a fixed annual fee for their services, and apply it to households regardless of balance. The most important thing to know about this plan is that a household’s balance must be above the fixed fee amount in order for fees to accrue. For example, if the fixed fee is $5,000, a balance of $4,999 would not accrue fees. Because fees accrue daily, if a household’s balance is below the set fixed fee amount at the close of market on any given day, no fee will accrue on that day. Since fees are assessed on a monthly or quarterly basis, the annual fee set by the firm will be prorated across each billing period. Tiered Billing Tiered billing allows for ranges to be set for both asset-based fees and fixed fees. The tiers work similar to tax brackets, in that only the assets held within each tier’s range are charged with that tier’s rate. Below is an example of what an asset-based tiered structure might look like. Example Tiered Billing Structure: Asset-Based Asset Range Rate $0 to $100,000 100 bps $100,001 to $500,000 75 bps Over $500,001 50 bps Households under the above tiered billing structure would be charged as follows: &nbsp; Balance Annual Fee Approx. Quarterly Fee Household 1 $50,000 $500 $125 Household 2 $225,000 $1,937.50 $484 Household 3 $2,600,000 $14,500 $3,625 Setting A Minimum Fee Advisors can utilize the tiered structure to set a minimum fee by setting a fixed fee for the lowest asset tier, and then applying an asset-based fee for the higher subsequent tiers. Just like under the fixed fee plan, a household’s assets must be higher than the lowest fixed fee rate in order for fees to start accruing. Example Tiered Billing Structure: Fixed Fee + Asset-Based Asset Range Rate $0 to $100,000 $1,000 per year $100,001 to $500,000 75 bps Over $500,001 50 bps If you have any questions about how Billing Plans work, head to our FAQs to find answers to the most commonly asked questions.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      6 Questions to Consider As You Evaluate Advisor Technology Platforms Sep 27, 2022 10:07:00 AM Use these six questions to help zero in on the best investment management technology for your needs—today and tomorrow. Considering adopting new technology designed to improve efficiency and enhance the client experience? Choosing the right tech for your advisory firm can be a matter of pure luck if you're not clear about what you're looking for. 1. Does this platform have the features that address my specific needs? Before you begin evaluating different technology solutions, identify the specific capabilities you need, then prioritize them based on which have potential for the greatest impact on your business. Some of the technology options available may include features you haven't identified as must-haves, but could contribute to overall efficiency improvements. Don't dismiss them offhand. It's important to involve staff members in this part of the process. Survey potential users and other stakeholders to find out their pain points so you can understand which current features they want to maintain, and where they feel gaps exist. 2. Does this platform address tomorrow's needs? Don't stop when you believe you have a solution that satisfies today's needs; look ahead to what you might need in the future. Your goal should be to adopt a platform that will serve you well today and in the years to come. The advisory industry and client needs are constantly evolving, and your technology should constantly adapt and align with the shifting landscape. 3. What technology solutions are my peers using? Another way to benchmark the technology solutions you may be considering is to check in with your financial advisor colleagues. Whether that's through informal conversations with peers during a conference, checking reviews in industry publications, or a forum question posed to an advisors-onlygroup you're involved in, you'll undoubtedly get some firsthand insights that can help inform your technology selection process. 4. How long before we're up and running? Depending on the scope and functionality of the technology being implemented, it may be a few weeks before you can fully rely on it to function as intended. Many, though, take just days. While your choice of platform should be primarily about its ability to deliver long-term value to you and your clients, finding one that starts improving productivity quickly can minimize distractions and optimize staff productivity. 5. How does the platform handle account opening and transitions? Account opening and transitions can be a definite pain point given the myriad of forms and potential systems required. When evaluating a tech solution, you'll want to understand how it might, or might not, ease this process. Will it make onboarding new clients more seamless and paperless though automated workflows? Or will multiple, time-consuming manual entries still be required? 6. How easy is the tool to use? Consider not only how intuitive and painless the technology in question is for you and your staff, but also for your clients. One study shows that 62% of millennials are getting their advice online or from social media. It's no secret that this generation, poised to inherit $68 trillion from the baby boomer generation, prefers more streamlined and intuitive user experiences. To better engage and reach clients in this younger set, you'll want to prioritize technologies that present an accessible interface and are enjoyable to use. Technology is an investment that can have significant impact on your business growth and how you serve your clients. Choose wisely, keeping in mind that you and your staff aren't the only ones who will benefit from it. Your clients' needs and experiences with your technology are equally important, and they should be top of mind as you evaluate your options. &nbsp; To learn more about Betterment for Advisors, get in touch with a member of our team.

      Betterment answers your tax season questions—from 401(k)s to HSAs Sep 27, 2022 12:00:00 AM A timely Q&amp;A about tax management on the Betterment platform. It’s tax time! Read on as Eric Bronnenkant, Betterment’s Head of Tax, and Nick Holeman, Betterment’s Head of Financial Planning, discuss common tax queries. Which combination of retirement accounts will likely provide this particular client the most beneficial tax savings over their lifetime?&nbsp; Nick: The words of this sentence were chosen very carefully because it's likely going to be that one retirement account alone is not enough to fully optimize things. It's going to be a combination, and it's going to depend on this particular client’s situation. We're not focused solely on minimizing taxes today. We want to try to minimize and control taxes over the client's lifetime to try and save them the most cumulative amount of taxes. And as we'll get into, that might not be the type of account that's going to give them the largest tax break today. So, we're going to dive in, but this is the underlying theme or question. The reason why this is so complicated is because there are so many factors and inputs to this decision—kind of this patchwork of special retirement accounts that Congress and the IRS have created over decades. This is why the question is so complicated for us advisors. It's also why it's so confusing for clients. And it's why there's so much bad advice out there. A lot of the clients that I work with have their own CPAs, and I can't tell you how many times I've had to correct them.&nbsp; A lot of CPAs are experts in tax, but they're not experts in looking 20-30 years down the road when it comes to retirement planning. So today, we want to focus on some of the more common scenarios and questions.&nbsp; Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA? Eric: While this can also potentially be looked at in the Traditional 401(k) versus the Roth 401(k), there are some nuanced differences there, too.&nbsp; For today, we're going to look at the Traditional IRA versus Roth IRA because this is something that typically the client has the most amount of control over in making their own decisions about what account type to choose. And there's a lot of uncertainty; as Nick pointed out, there's also a lot of information. Some of it's good, and some of it could use improvement.&nbsp; So, thinking about someone who's 25, single, earning $50K: Should they be in the Traditional IRA or the Roth IRA? What’s better for them?&nbsp; Eric: Nobody really knows the answer to that question today. You really only know the answer to that question after a whole lifetime. What are your initial thoughts, Nick? What jumps out at you when you look at this type of scenario? Nick: Yeah, I like that we're starting with the basics and we're going to build onto the more complex topics. This is one instance where I tend to agree with the standard advice I hear from other CFP® professionals: When you're younger, you're likely able to expect your income to grow. So paying taxes now is going to be better than paying taxes later. In general, without knowing too much about this client situation, I would probably recommend Roth if I had to give an answer. For someone who's age 40, married, and has earnings of $250K: What type of IRA do you think they might want to consider? Nick: This is where we start to get borderline on some of those tax rules. I don't know all of their adjustments or other things that might lower their modified AGI, but here we're probably going to be phased out of a Roth, so we might not have a choice. We would go with a Traditional IRA. Maybe that's when we start getting into the more advanced topics, like a backdoor Roth IRA. But yeah, probably Traditional. Eric: Right. Regardless of how much money you make, you can always contribute to a Traditional IRA. You just may not get a tax deduction for it if you're covered by a retirement plan at work and you make too much money. So the Roth income limit, you get phased out at about $208,000 for last year; $214,000 this year. It would be tough, even for married couples maxing out their 401(k),to potentially help them get below those thresholds. Tough to meet those MAGI limits. But you definitely brought up a great point as far as the backdoor Roth. So for people who make too much money to contribute to the Roth directly, they can contribute to the Traditional and then do the conversion over to Roth. Fun fact: the Roth conversion income limitation was eliminated permanently in 2010, and as of right now, there is nothing on the horizon that is going to change that. Obviously laws can always change, but it is not scheduled to return at this point. Nick: Backdoor Roths are super powerful potential strategies for high income earners. We talk about them a lot with our clients at Betterment. They're a little more complex, so they're not usually part of the baseline retirement plan that we're building up, but if they have a tax professional involved who’s keeping track of the Form 8606 so they're not getting double-taxed, then a backdoor Roth can be a super powerful strategy. Do contributions to a Traditional 401(k) help me qualify for a Traditional IRA deduction or a Roth IRA contribution? Eric: So let's say you have a married couple where one spouse is earning $214,000, and one spouse put in the $20,500 into their 401(k), now that $20,500 would put them below the Roth income limit. Then they'd go from a situation where they weren't able to make any Roth contribution directly to being able to make the full $6,000 or $7,000 Roth contribution directly. So a contribution to a Traditional 401(k) may help you qualify for other benefits, like a deduction on a Traditional or making direct contributions to a Roth or even other things, like child tax credits and any other AGI sensitive items. Do tax-free withdrawals from a Roth IRA impact social security benefits and Medicare premiums in retirement? Nick: Roth IRAs don't impact social security benefits. They don't impact Medicare premiums. Those are two big potential ways to optimize retirement down the road. It's not just looking at tax brackets, either. I know oftentimes when Eric and I will chat, we’re like, ‘Oh, it's current bracket versus future bracket, and you can kind of decide which one is best.’ And that's true, but that's a little bit too simplified. We know tax brackets fluctuate, and there are other things aside from taxation, as well: social security, Medicare premiums, things like that. So big shout out to Roths if they make sense for each client, but just a reminder not to only focus on tax brackets. Can I withdraw contributions from a Roth IRA without tax/penalties? Eric: The power of the Roth is that you're able to withdraw your regular contributions at any time — tax and penalty free — regardless of your age. Some people use it as an emergency fund; that is a possibility. If you can afford to have a Roth and an emergency fund, that's even better. Let's say you need to use your Roth as an emergency fund: it is potentially a tax-efficient way to withdraw those regular contributions tax and penalty free regardless of your age. I do want to point out that if you wanted to withdraw the earnings, which would come out second, those are subject to tax and penalty if you're under age 59-and-a-half. 401(k) vs. IRA? Eric: The first thing you should think about in this type of scenario is: Can I contribute to both my IRA and my 401(k)? I'm not sure where this rumor got started, but it's definitely been flying around the internet for a long time that if you contribute to a 401(k), you can't contribute to an IRA, which is not true. You can contribute to both. Now, what could potentially be impacted is that if you contribute to a 401(k), you may not get a deduction for your Traditional IRA contribution. So is there an interrelationship of the two? Yes. But it's not that you won't be able to make the Traditional IRA contribution, you just may not get a deduction for it. What are some other reasons why you might want to prioritize a 401(k) versus an IRA? Nick: I'll go with one of the less common ones to make this interesting. Behavioral benefits, right? A 401(k) contribution is going to come directly out of your paycheck before it even hits your account. At Betterment, we're big fans of automation. Out of sight out of mind. If it's so easy to spend your money, we want to try to make it just as easy to save your money. So 401(k)s or auto-deposits into an IRA, vice versa. Those are some great benefits that you can do with their 401(k).&nbsp; Can I access 401(k) funds 10% penalty-free at age 55? Eric: Not everyone wants to work until age 59-and-a-half. Retiring early is on a lot of people's minds, and most people are pretty familiar with the fact that if you want to access 401(k) funds before 59-and-a-half, you have to pay a 10% penalty. IRA 10% penalty exceptions versus 401(k), 10% penalty exceptions are not symmetric. Some are the same, but some are not the same.&nbsp; Nick: 401(k)s are great for age 55 early withdrawals. That's a big win, right? We're talking to more and more clients who are, I don’t know if 55 necessarily counts as FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early), but we're talking to more and more clients who are getting really into that.&nbsp; Can I borrow against an IRA? Nick: We don't love seeing that, but there's a little more flexibility with borrowing against the 401(k). Eric: Actually, a fun fact about the 55-or-later rule is that you don't even have to be 55, as long as you separate from service in the year you turn 55 or later. So you could potentially turn 55 on Christmas day and leave your job on January 1st of that year, and you still qualify for that 10% penalty exception. One thing you shouldn't do if you want to keep that exception is roll those funds over to an IRA, because you'll lose that 10% penalty exception, even though you're allowed to rollover. Nick: You want to make sure you've got enough funds to be able to bridge the gap between 55 and 59-and-a-half. So you might do a partial rollover, for example. Eric, I don't know what your thoughts are on that, but make sure you're not leaving them hanging out to dry in that little window there. Eric: Yeah. I mean, is the 401(k) penalty-free provision useful? Absolutely. Is it the best thing? Not necessarily. If, let's say, you don't like your 401(k) investment options, you could roll it over to your IRA and then do substantially equal periodic payments for five years, which is longer than 59-and-a-half, so&nbsp;that's more restrictive. If you were willing to give up some control on your payment timing, you still might find the IRA option more attractive.&nbsp; I want to use a retirement plan to partially fund a new home purchase. Should I use my IRA or 401(k) first? Eric: There are a few different ways to fund that. Obviously if people have enough extra money in their non-retirement accounts, that's typically the first place they're looking to fund that first-time home purchase, but not everyone has a 20% down payment available in cash. People are always looking at other alternatives for funds, and that would include a 401(k) and an IRA. What are your thoughts on the 401(k) versus IRA in this scenario, Nick? Nick: My real thoughts would be neither. Typically if a client's asking me this question, it means that they either didn't plan or they're kind of feeling pressured out of a situation or going beyond their budget. So I know that's being a little judgmental, but typically I discourage both. Your IRA has that $10,000 first time-home exemption, 401(k), you may be able to&nbsp;take out a loan and the provisions are a little bit more flexible if that loan is for home purchase. Depending on the situation, I would probably go to my IRA because it has that smaller limit; it would prohibit them from dipping too much into their 401(k). But there are definitely pros and cons to each. Eric: Right. So you can do the Roth IRA. And now, obviously this is if you need the money, because Roth IRAs are such a powerful retirement savings tool, and the longer you hold the money in there, the better. But let's say you need the money: You could withdraw all of your regular contributions, first tax and penalty free. And then if you've had the account open for at least five years, you can withdraw up to $10,000 of earnings tax and penalty free, too. That can count as a qualified distribution. So an IRA may be useful, but some people have most of their money set aside in their 401(k). And that's where a loan with generous repayment terms, where you're able to push that out over a long period of time, may be attractive. Nick: True. Maybe this is me, but the whole benefit of Roth IRAs is tax-free growth. So if you're not getting a lot of tax-free growth, you're missing out on some of the benefits. It only makes sense to be invested aggressively if you're looking at a long-term time horizon. If you're planning on using a Roth IRA to buy a house next year, you shouldn't have had that money invested super aggressively anyways, which means you're probably looking at cash or more conservative investments, which means you're missing out on the single biggest benefit of Roth IRAs in general, which is tax-free growth. So again, I just don't understand why I see so many people talking about using your Roth IRA for this home purchase exemption or for your emergency fund. I don't understand it, unless it's an absolute emergency; not something I typically recommend. Eric: That's fair. When you're thinking about whether you should be buying a home in the first place, you do want to think about: ‘How is this going to impact my retirement, especially if I'm going to use some or all of my retirement funds?’ to fund that home purchase. HSA vs. 401(k)? Eric: I love HSAs, and I know Nick loves HSAs. You can put money in pre-tax, and it's pre-federal tax, pre-social security, pre-Medicare, pre-most state taxes, except for mine in New Jersey — and California. In general, it's pre-tax across the board and it grows tax deferred, and then the withdrawals come out tax-free in retirement or for qualified medical expenses. There are lower limits for the HSA than for the 401(k) and different rules about what you use the funds for along the way. You actually might be able to save more money in taxes on an HSA contribution than a Traditional 401(k), because the Traditional 401(k) doesn't save you on any social security or Medicare taxes. Those you're always contributing to after those taxes have been applied.&nbsp; I want to maximize retirement savings. Can I use the HSA as a retirement savings vehicle and a medical savings vehicle? Nick: I've seen a lot of advisors get into some sticky situations when recommending using HSAs for retirement. They're not right for everyone. The two biggest rookie mistakes that I see are getting too excited and recommending an HSA without remembering that you need to pair an HSA with a high deductible healthcare plan. If the high deductible plan doesn't make sense for the client in the first place, then the HSA probably doesn't make sense. And the second is if you're going to be using your HSA for retirement, you're probably looking at investing it in more aggressive investments, which means they're going to be a lot more volatile. Whenever I recommend a client use an HSA for retirement, I pretty much tell them we're not going to do this until we have a fully funded emergency fund as well, separate from the HSA, because Murphy's law, worst-case scenario. If we're going to have your HSA be aggressive, I want to make sure that the client also has a separate, lower risk emergency fund just in case something happens. Eric: All great points. I do want to clarify: In New Jersey HSAs are not pre-tax; in Pennsylvania, 401(k)s are not pre-tax, but you do get the HSA deduction in Pennsylvania and you do get the 401(k) contribution in New Jersey. So you always want to look at state laws. They may not drive your decision, but they may be a factor in your ultimate decision. Nick: That's why I always caveat: Make sure to bring in your CPA if you have a client, and make sure that you're all working together. They might know something that you don't, that’s state-specific to your rules or something like that. I want to live a tax-free lifestyle in retirement. Is the trifecta to use an HSA with a Roth IRA and Roth 401(k)? Eric: I love talking about the tax-free lifestyle. How can you get to that point? Well, there are ways. Let's say you max out your Roth 401(k), $20,500, you're not getting any break upfront, but then all the earnings come out tax-free in retirement. Roth IRA for another 6,000 there, no tax break upfront, all the earnings are tax-free in retirement. And then the HSA, you're getting a tax break upfront and even if you're not using it for medical expenses, once you're over 65, then you'll pay taxes. You can also use what's called the shoe box rule, where if you keep track of all of your unreimbursed medical expenses since you opened your HSA, you can use that as an account to withdraw from based on all of those previous expenses. If you accumulated $50,000 worth of expenses since your HSA was opened, you'd still be able to withdraw $50,000 in retirement even though in that year, you may have had no medical expenses at all, because you're able to use that kind of look-back process. Nick: That's personally what I do. I'm looking forward to that. I don't have an actual shoe box, but I've got a spreadsheet — and it's a beautiful spreadsheet. So I'm excited for that. Eric: There are also a number of apps out there where you can save your receipts, whether it comes by email, you can just put that in the app, or you can take a picture if you're at the doctor's office. There are plenty of ways to track these receipts and expenses over time in an efficient way. SEP vs. Solo 401(k)? Eric: There are a lot of self-employed people out there, and they’re always asking, ‘Should I do the SEP or the Solo 401(k)?’ The answer, as with most tax questions, is it depends. It depends on if your goal is to maximize your savings, if your goal is to minimize regulatory filings, there are a variety of factors to consider. Your SEP contribution, you can do 20% of your net earnings from self-employment, up to $61,000. But that's still only 20%. There's no employee contribution — it's all employer contributions. Whereas the Solo 401(k) allows for employee contributions as well as employer contributions and generally still has the same overall limit as the SEP, except for people who are age 50 or older.&nbsp; Let's say we had someone who's a self-employed, 50-year-old who has a business profit of $100,000. SEP or Solo 401(k)? Eric: That person can do just $20,000 into the SEP, but if they did the Solo 401(k), they'd be able to do the $20,000 employer contribution plus the $27,000 employee contribution because that's the $20,500 standard contribution, plus the $6,500 for being 50 or older. Obviously that would take up a significant portion of their $100,000, but at the end of the day, if they have extra money in savings elsewhere that they could use to help maximize their retirement savings, that's something they may want to consider. I prefer to minimize the possibility of regulatory filings. Should I make contributions to a SEP or Solo 401(k)? Nick: Oftentimes when I'm speaking with a small business owner, they might not be able to save that much. Last year, a lot of the entrepreneurs I was talking to had a little bit of a rough year, to say the least. And if you're looking at starting a retirement plan for your self-employed business, SEPs, you might not be able to contribute quite as much. Sometimes, for a lot of people starting out their business, that's not an issue. They wish contribution limits were something they had to worry about, but they're trying to get their business up and running. They’re also just trying to find time in the day to do everything. So for the SEP, if you're not even bumping up against the contribution limits and it requires less regulatory filing, and it's just a little bit easier, it's something to consider. You might be able to contribute more with a Solo 401(k), but on the SEP side, there are some other advantages as well. Eric: Why do people love the SEP? The SEP has no filings with the Department of Labor. As a Solo 401(k), there is a Form 5500 filing once the assets get over $250,000, whereas regardless of how much money is in the SEP, there are no Form 5500 filings. And while I don't think the Form 5500 is particularly burdensome, most people I know would prefer to file fewer forms with the government. I definitely appreciate the avoidance of filing any additional paperwork, even if it's not that burdensome. I want to make Roth type contributions. Should I make contributions to a SEP or a Solo 401K? Nick: I don't think so. Eric: No, there is no Roth SEP. Now what you could do is convert your SEP contribution into a Roth, because there aren't income limits on doing conversions. But if you want to make a regular Roth-type contribution, then it would have to be an employee contribution to a Solo 401(k) subject to the $20,500 or $27,000 annual limits. There are pros and cons on both sides here, and it's very client-specific on whether they prefer the SEP or the Solo 401(k). Which retirement plan should I make contributions to in order to make tax/penalty-free withdrawals before retirement? Nick: There's a few options. The easiest is just a plain old taxable brokerage account. There's no contribution limits, there's no age requirements, there's no early withdrawal penalties. They're a little bit easier to plan for; again, you might be missing out on some of the tax benefits, but that's one. HSAs are one as well; it doesn't have an age limit, as long as you've got qualified medical expenses. Roth IRAs, you can withdraw your contributions penalty free and tax free at any time. So there's lots of choices. Eric: Getting back to what we were discussing before, the 55-or-later exception is a powerful tool to access funds pre-59-and-a half without a 10% penalty and avoiding the substantially equal periodic payment option. Being able to withdraw those raw Roth contributions at any time is good too, but the closer that you get to 59-and-a-half, you also want to be particularly cautious. Let's say if you have a Roth IRA and you withdraw earnings before you're 59-and-a-half, those are typically subject to a regular income tax and a 10% penalty. So, whereas if you had made the five years plus 59-and-a-half, you would have gotten that tax free. The difference could potentially be if you're the day before 59-and-a-half. Then it's possible though that you would have to pay taxes and penalty on earnings, whereas once you make it to 59-and-a-half, and you've had the account open for five years, then you get it tax free. It's a very binary type of thing, and you always want to be cautious about where you are relative to that line in the sand. Can Roth conversions be part of an early retirement strategy? Eric: Early retirement is not for everyone. Some people are able to afford it. Some people try to fit their life into an early retirement strategy, and for some people, that works better than others. One thing you already mentioned was some of the five-year rules. If you do a Roth conversion of pre-tax money before you're 59-and-a-half and you want to withdraw those funds in the future before you're 59-and-a-half, there is a five-year holding period for each conversion to avoid the 10% penalty. This rule is designed to prevent people from converting and withdrawing immediately to avoid the 10% penalty. You can still do a conversion at age 45, age 46, age 47, age 48, let's say a rolling conversion strategy, which then you'll be able to access those converted amounts five years later, tax and penalty free. Again, those earnings would have to stay in the Roth until 59-and-a-half to avoid any tax or penalty. Nick: Good points. One thing I found practical to keep in my toolkit so to speak is to get familiar with the IRS website. That sounds like that's a terrifying task, but Google is your friend. “IRS gov Roth IRA,” for example, the first hit is likely going to be the contribution limits for that particular year. So if you forget, it's just something that’s good to be familiar with. Not everyone has an Eric that they can just Slack on demand. I'd say bookmark them, familiarize yourself with them. The IRS has some pretty good pages on Roth IRA, contribution limits, Traditional IRA deductibility limits. So if you can't remember them or keep track with them every year, just get used to Googling.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      FAQ: Agreement Automation Process Sep 27, 2022 12:00:00 AM The Betterment for Advisors Client Agreement Automation function will make onboarding your new clients fast, easy, and completely paperless. Will my firm need to update our ADV and/or Customer Agreement to reflect the incorporation of Betterment for Advisors into my practice? Yes, you will need to update your Form ADV Part 2A and most likely your Customer Agreement to reflect the incorporation of Betterment for Advisors into your practice, including (among other things) how your firm uses Betterment’s sub-advisory and brokerage services, and Betterment’s fees. Since each situation is unique, please consult with your attorney or compliance officer. Can Betterment for Advisors automate the signing of my agreement with my client? Yes, you can provide PDF versions of your client agreement, Form ADV Part 2, and privacy policy to include as part of the electronic signup process a client undergoes with Betterment. We also provide reporting in your dashboard about which versions your clients have agreed to, and when. You can read more about our agreement automation feature, including legal disclosures, here. What relationship does the client have with Betterment? Betterment acts as the sub-advisor to your client. You still remain the primary advisor to your client. When your client goes through the new account opening process, they will sign an agreement with Betterment directly as the sub-advisor, and, if you wish, an agreement with your firm directly as the primary advisor. Describe the process your product uses to convert information provided by the client into a risk profile in the interview process. The platform automatically recommends investment goals and associated recommended allocations for each such goal for new accounts established on the platform using the client’s age, information provided by the client during account creation regarding a particular financial goal, and the type of legal account. Am I able to see an archive of electronically executed client agreements? If so, what does this look like? If you enable the agreement automation feature to deliver a paperless account opening process for your clients, an archive of the date/time stamp and the version of the agreement that each client electronically signed is housed on the “Agreements” tab of the advisor dashboard. To learn more about our agreement automation feature, please see here.

    <p class="item-title">Introducing Target Income Portfolios from BlackRock</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Introducing Target Income Portfolios from BlackRock Sep 26, 2022 12:00:00 AM Partnering with BlackRock, you and your clients can access an income portfolio strategy that aims to deliver cash income while preserving capital. To help you better serve your clients with a preference for a relatively low risk investment strategy, Betterment for Advisors offers a Target Income portfolio strategy sourced from BlackRock. If you’re familiar with BlackRock’s income bond ETFs, you know that the Target Income portfolio strategy is a diversified 100% bond basket that seeks to provide a steady stream of cash income while minimizing potential loss of capital or stock market volatility. In offering the BlackRock Target Income portfolios, we provide four target income levels to choose from, each with different expected levels of yield generation. This portfolio strategy is available to Betterment’s retail customers in addition to Betterment for Advisors’ clients. An income portfolio strategy is part of Betterment’s objective for offering customers’ greater personalization to meet their needs and preferences. In order for some investors to use this new income portfolio strategy successfully, they may need guidance from an advisor who understands their situation, and in many cases, we expect the firms on the Betterment for Advisors platform to play that role. We are firm in our belief that offering personalized portfolio strategies like this one is a way to grow your business. Keep reading to explore two scenarios where we see this portfolio being potentially useful for your clients. Generating Retirement Income As advisors know well, many retirees value stable income and principal preservation during the later stages of their lives. They also tend to hold most of their wealth in tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s. The Target Income portfolio strategy is one way to meet retirees’ preferences.&nbsp; It’s important to note that any income-focused strategy will be inherently less tax-efficient than a strategy that balances income and growth because bond interest is taxed at a higher rate than long-term capital gains. Relatively Low Risk Investment Alternative In addition to the retirement use case, we believe the Target Income portfolio strategy could also be useful for clients who show considerable anxiety about the stock market. If your client strongly prefers not to invest in stocks, the Target Income portfolio strategy can be an effective, personalized approach. It’s one way to make sure their money doesn’t sit idly in cash without taking on more risk than they are comfortable with. It’s worth noting that your clients will pay a higher expense ratio on the Target Income portfolio funds compared to funds invested in the Betterment Core portfolio. The Betterment Core portfolio strategy, which contains a mix of stocks and bonds, has asset-weighted expense ratios of only 0.05% - 0.13%, depending on the portfolio’s allocation. The BlackRock Target Income portfolio strategy, while still relatively lower cost, has slightly higher asset-weighted expense ratios of 0.13% - 0.24%, depending on the portfolio’s target income level. Different Income Targets to Meet Clients’ Needs As with the other portfolio strategies available to Betterment for Advisors, the Target Income&nbsp; portfolio strategy can adjust to your clients’ risk tolerance. The Target Income portfolio strategy includes four different income levels to choose from, each with different targeted levels of expected yield. This strategy is actively managed, so the exact allocations of the underlying bonds are subject to change approximately once per quarter (and up to 6 times per year depending on market volatility). With each rebalance, we allocate to the asset classes that are designed to help your clients maximize their income return while limiting overall volatility. The Target income portfolio increases projected income by taking on more risk in two main ways: Investing in longer-term bonds: Long-term bonds are more sensitive to changes in interest rates, and thus carry more risk. To compensate for this risk, long-term bonds generally pay more interest.&nbsp; Investing in lower-quality bonds: When you lend money from less-established companies, the chances of the company defaulting and not paying you back are higher. To compensate for this risk, low quality bonds generally pay more interest. Higher yield target portfolios may have larger exposure to lower-quality bonds.&nbsp; Whether you have a retiree who wants to focus on income rather than growth or a nervous investor who would feel better with bonds rather than stocks, we hope this portfolio offering will help every advisor further personalize their services and offer investors more added value. You can explore the Target Income portfolio strategy by BlackRock alongside the other portfolio strategies within your advisor dashboard.

    <p class="item-title">How Portfolio Rebalancing Works to Manage Risk for Your Clients</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      How Portfolio Rebalancing Works to Manage Risk for Your Clients Sep 26, 2022 12:00:00 AM Portfolio rebalancing, when done effectively, can help manage risk and keep your clients on track to pursue the expected returns desired to meet their goals. What is rebalancing? Over time, the value of individual ETFs in a diversified portfolio moves up and down, drifting away from the target weights that help achieve proper diversification. Over the long term, stocks generally rise faster than bonds, so the stock portion of your client's portfolio will likely go up relative to the bond portion—except when you rebalance the client’s portfolio to target the original allocation. The difference between the target allocation for your client's portfolio and the actual weights in your client's current portfolio (e.g. their actual allocation) is called portfolio drift. Measuring Portfolio Drift At Betterment, we define portfolio drift as the total deviation of each asset class (put in positive terms) from its target allocation weight, divided by two. Here’s a simplified example, with only four assets: &nbsp; Target Current Deviation (±) U.S. Bonds 25% 30% 5% International Bonds 25% 20% 5% U.S. Stocks 25% 30% 5% International Stocks 25% 20% 5% Total &nbsp; &nbsp; 20% Total ÷ 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; 10% &nbsp; A high drift may expose your client to more (or less) risk than you intended when you set the target allocation, and much of that risk may be uncompensated—meaning that the portfolio isn’t targeting higher expected returns by taking on the additional risk. Taking actions to reduce this drift is called rebalancing, which Betterment automatically does for your client in several ways, depending on the circumstances, and always with an eye on tax efficiency. Cash Flow Rebalancing This method involves either buying or selling, but not both, and generally occurs when cash flows into or out of the portfolio are happening anyway. Cash flows (deposit, dividend reinvestment or withdrawal) can be used to rebalance your client's portfolio.&nbsp; Fractional shares allow us to allocate these cash flows with precision to the penny. Inflows: Your client may be rebalanced if they make a deposit, including when they auto-deposit or receive dividends in their account. We use the inflow to buy the asset classes your clients are currently under-weight, reducing their drift. The result is that the need to sell in order to rebalance is reduced (and with sufficient inflows, eliminated completely). No sales means no capital gains, which means no taxes will be owed. This method is so desirable that we’ve built it directly into our application. Whenever client drift is higher than normal (generally 2% or higher), we calculate the deposit required to reduce the client's drift to zero, and make it easy for them to make the deposit. Although we show the deposit amount needed to bring drift back to 0%, smaller deposits also help reduce drift. In fact, the first dollars deposited have the largest impact on reducing drift. This means, for example, that depositing half the amount recommended to reduce drift to 0% will generally reduce drift by more than half. Portfolio Drift vs. Deposit Size The chart above is a hypothetical, illustrative example of the relationship between portfolio drift and deposits needed to rebalance without selling any assets. The blue line in the chart demonstrates the general relationship between deposit size and drift. As you can see, the first dollars of a deposit reduce drift by more than the last dollars. The dotted grey line shows what a linear relationship between drift and deposits would look like. Withdrawals (and other outflows) are likewise used to rebalance, by first selling asset classes that are overweight. (Once that is achieved, we sell all asset classes equally to keep you in balance.) We employ a sophisticated ‘lot selection’ algorithm called TaxMin within asset classes to minimize the tax impact as much as possible in taxable accounts. Sell/Buy Rebalancing In the absence of cash flows, we rebalance by selling and buying, reshuffling assets that are already in the portfolio. When cash flows are not sufficient to keep your client's portfolio’s drift within a certain tolerance, we sell just enough of the overweight asset classes, and use the proceeds to buy into the underweight asset classes to reduce the drift to zero. Sell/Buy rebalancing is generally triggered whenever the portfolio drift reaches or exceeds 3%. Our algorithms check your client's drift approximately once per day, and rebalance if necessary. Note: In addition to the higher threshold, we built in another restriction into the rebalancing algorithm for taxable accounts. As with any sell trade, our tax minimization algorithm seeks to select the lowest tax impact lots, and stops before selling any lots that would realize short-term capital gains when possible. Since short-term capital gains are taxed at a higher rate than long-term capital gains, we can achieve higher after-tax outcomes by simply waiting for those lots to become long-term before rebalancing, if it's still necessary at that point. As a result, it’s possible for your client's portfolio to stay above the 3% drift if we have no long-term lots to sell. Almost always, it’s because the account is less than a year old. In this case, we recommend rebalancing via a deposit to avoid taxes. The Portfolio tab of a client’s goal will show your client know how much to deposit, as described above, to rebalance via cash flow. Please note that for advised clients on our Betterment For Advisors platform, the drift threshold is 5% for portfolios that contain mutual funds. For custom model portfolios, advisors can set a custom drift threshold. Allocation Change Rebalancing Changing your client's target allocation by moving the allocation slider and confirming the change could also cause a rebalance. Because you have chosen a new target allocation, Betterment will give you the option to select one of our three tax-aware migration strategies.&nbsp; Depending on which option you select, this could result in selling securities and could possibly realize capital gains. As with all sell trades, we will utilize our tax minimization algorithm to help reduce the tax impact. Additionally, before your client confirms the allocation change, we will let them know the potential tax impact of the change with Tax Impact Preview. Transaction Timelines If you’d like to turn off your client's automated rebalancing so that Betterment only rebalances your client's portfolio in response to cash flows (i.e., deposits, withdrawals, or dividend reinvestments) and not by reshuffling assets already in the portfolio, please contact our support team at support@bettermentforadvisors.com.&nbsp;

      Advisor Guide to Betterment Transfers Sep 26, 2022 12:00:00 AM &nbsp; &nbsp; Table of Contents Transferring Qualified Accounts Direct IRA Transfers 401(k) and Employer-Sponsored Plan Rollovers Indirect IRA Transfers Inherited IRA Transfers Transferring Taxable Accounts Taxable ACATS Transfers Non-ACATS ACH Bank Deposits Get Support &nbsp; Transferring Qualified Accounts To get started, you’ll first need to ensure your client has opened the appropriate receiving Betterment IRA. If they have not done so already, you can log into your advisor dashboard, select the specific client’s “Overview” page, and then click “Add Account.” From there, you’ll be guided through the automated account opening flow. Once your client has approved the opening of the new account, you’ll be able to move forward with the actual direct IRA transfer request by clicking “Start a Transfer” from your advisor dashboard. At the end of the flow, your client will be emailed further instructions. As their advisor, you will be copied on this email to retain oversight and provide any needed guidance. Not every retirement account is eligible to be moved using the same transfer method. Our rollover flow is designed to analyze and select the most appropriate option available, given the specific account information provided by you and your client. Important note: The questions we prompt you to answer within the automated transfer flow will be used to pre-fill your client’s actual transfer request form. It’s critical that you enter accurate and up to date information on behalf of your client. Generally, when a transfer request fails or is rejected by a contra-firm, it's due to incomplete or mismatching information provided. Having a recent client statement on hand is a good best practice. We suggest confirming the following pieces of information before you get started: Client’s current account type: Legal account type and brokerage status. Client’s current account number Client’s current clearing broker: Enter the clearing broker’s name in the “Current Provider” field when prompted. Direct IRA Transfers At a high level, the possible direct IRA transfer options at Betterment are: Full or partial ACATS transfer of supported investments plus any cash. Generally, this takes 5-6 business days to complete. When adding your client’s specific tickers, if any search returns a “No match” or you receive a notice that says the ticker is not supported, you’ll only be able to submit a PARTIAL TRANSFER REQUEST on behalf of your client. Any requests submitted for a full transfer will be rejected. Supported investments will be moved in-kind to Betterment. Once received, we will liquidate any investments to cash and reinvest all the proceeds into their IRA portfolio here. Electronic fax of the client’s direct IRA transfer form to their contra firm. Generally, this takes 7-10 business days to complete. There is no physical paperwork required. Client will consent to the transfer by e-signing the transfer form and then the fax will be automatically sent by Betterment. IRA proceeds will be sent to Betterment via a mailed check and automatically reinvested into your client’s IRA portfolio here. Pre-filled direct IRA transfer form and instructions, which must be printed, signed, and mailed to the contra firm by the client. Generally, this takes 14-21 business days to complete. The client must take action from their side for the transfer to complete. In some cases, the contra firm may also require a notary or a medallion signature guarantee. IRA proceeds will be sent to Betterment via a mailed check and automatically reinvested into your client’s IRA portfolio here. If your client is attempting to transfer an inherited IRA, refer to our Inherited IRA FAQ. 401(k) and Employer-Sponsored Plan Rollovers Moving retirement money from an employer-sponsored account—such as a 401(k) or 403(b)—into an IRA is usually not an option via ACATS. We still attempt to automate this rollover process as much as possible. We generally do not need any paperwork from you or the client. You can simply get started by clicking “Transfer or Rollover” from your client’s Overview page. The rollover flow will guide you through a series of questions and then we’ll email your client a full set of personalized instructions for how to proceed. The instructions will lay out the exact next steps to take and will contain the information your client needs to complete their rollover. This includes their unique Betterment IRA account number, how their provider should make their rollover check payable, and where they can mail the rollover check. Many providers will accept employer-sponsored rollover requests from a client verbally, effectively avoiding any paperwork requirements from their side. We encourage advisors to call the current provider—with the client on the line—to verbally request any high-value rollovers.&nbsp;It’s worth noting that some providers may still require your client to fill out special rollover paperwork. If so, there’s no way around that. If any additional paperwork is required, please send all requests to support@bettermentforadvisors.com. Lastly, we will notify you and your client via email as soon as their rollover funds are invested into their IRA and everything is complete. Click here to get started. Indirect IRA Transfers In some cases, an indirect IRA transfer or rollover may be the only option available to your client. The good news is that this can prevent delays due to contra-firm requirements. Any cash proceeds from an early distribution out of your client’s qualified account, which meets the requirements related to indirect rollovers, can be re-deposited into Betterment by instructing your client to make a cash ACH deposit from their linked bank account into their Betterment IRA. If your client has not already done so, they can use these instructions to link their primary bank account. When your client is ready to make their deposit, please be sure they complete the following: Direct your client to log into their account and select “Deposit” from their Home page. The client will be prompted to choose which account to make their deposit into. If they have more than one IRA open, please be sure your client knows which one to choose specifically. Once the IRA has been selected, they will be asked to select a deposit type. Please be sure your client chooses “Indirect IRA Rollover.” Inherited IRA Transfers If your client is attempting to transfer an inherited IRA, refer to our Inherited IRA FAQ. Please copy your client and email support@bettermentforadvisors.com with the following information: Name of current provider. Type of IRA (Traditional or Roth). The IRA account number at the current provider. Indicate “full” or partial transfer. Provide the exact dollar amount to transfer if partial. Name of original IRA account holder. Since we will need to open a new legal account type, please have the client review our Customer Agreement and send us the statement, “I agree to the terms and conditions of the Customer Agreement, and I give Betterment permission to open an inherited IRA account on my behalf.” Your email will be directed to one of our rollover specialists, who will set up the inherited account at Betterment and guide you and your client through the next steps. Transferring Taxable Accounts Taxable ACATS Transfers When possible, Betterment recommends using the ACATS method to move taxable brokerage accounts to Betterment. Generally, an ACATS transfer is faster and more convenient than other types of transfers. Betterment supports ACATS transfers of nearly all ETFs, many mutual funds, some single stocks, and cash positions. We’ve created an automated taxable account transfer flow, which will ask you a series of questions on behalf of your client and ultimately determine if the account is eligible for an automated transfer. It’s possible that some of your client’s holdings are not currently allowed to be moved via ACATS. When prompted to add your client’s specific tickers, if any search returns a “No match” or you receive a notice that says the ticker is not supported, unfortunately, you’ll only be able to submit a PARTIAL TRANSFER REQUEST on behalf of your client, for the supported tickers. Any requests submitted for a full transfer will be rejected. For any holdings that we cannot move via ACATS, you can direct your client to liquidate and then transfer the cash proceeds to Betterment. Any related tax implications should be discussed prior to making this recommendation to your client. Click here to get started.&nbsp; Important note: The questions we prompt you to answer within the automated transfer flow will be used to pre-fill your client’s actual transfer request form. It’s critical that you enter accurate and up to date information on behalf of your client. Generally, when a transfer request fails or is rejected by a contra-firm, it’s due to user error.&nbsp; Having a recent client statement on hand is a good best practice. We suggest confirming the following pieces of information before getting started: Client’s current account type: Legal account type and brokerage status. Client’s current account number Client’s current clearing broker: Enter the clearing broker’s name in the “Current Provider” field when prompted. Please email support@bettermentforadvisors.com for any questions regarding your client’s taxable account requirements or ACATS eligibility. Non-ACATS ACH Bank Deposits Your client can initiate a cash deposit into a taxable Betterment account at any time, as long as they have successfully linked their bank account. For any taxable money they wish to move to Betterment that cannot be moved via ACATS, you can instruct your client to liquidate to cash and then move the cash proceeds to their linked bank account for funding. Any related tax implications should be discussed prior to making this recommendation to your client. To initiate the ACH deposit, instruct your client to click “Deposit” from their Home page. Note: We only allow electronic transfers from your client’s checking account via the ACH network and do not accept personal checks. For transfers greater than $300,000, wire instructions may be generated. There is no fee from Betterment for wires, but please have your client check with their bank for any fees they may be charged. To access a client’s specific wire instructions, log in as the client, select “Transfers”, then “Wire Transfers”, and follow the prompts. Get Support As always, our support team is available to assist with any questions related to moving your client’s assets. Please email support@bettermentforadvisors.com and copy your relationship manager. For more immediate assistance, call 888-646-2581.

    <p class="item-title">FAQ: Integration Partners</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      FAQ: Integration Partners Sep 23, 2022 12:00:00 AM Betterment has integrations set up with several third-party platforms across financial planning, CRM, and performance reporting tools. Do you integrate with portfolio management systems? Yes, we currently integrate with Orion, BlackDiamond, Advyzon, and Addepar. Our integrations with portfolio management systems are at the firm level and include detailed account information for all clients across the firm, such as tax lots and cost basis. Do you integrate with any CRMs? Yes, firms using Redtail or Wealthbox CRM software can see Betterment client account information within the CRM interface once you enable the integration. To enable Redtail integration, please email&nbsp;support@bettermentforadvisors.com with your&nbsp;Redtail&nbsp;username. Once you receive confirmation that the integration is enabled via email, you will be able to see client account information and balances in Redtail. This can take several days. To enable Wealthbox, first login to Wealthbox. Visit the Applications area, select Betterment for Advisors, choose Enable and click “Request Betterment integration”. Once you receive confirmation that the integration is enabled via email, you will be able to see client account information, balances, recent transactions and tax lots in Wealthbox’s Betterment tab. This can take several days. Do you integrate with any financial planning tools? Yes, we currently integrate with RightCapital, eMoney Advisor, and&nbsp;MoneyGuidePro. Our integration with RightCapital is at the firm level and at the client-level for eMoney and MoneyGuidePro. Client-level integrations require your clients to link their Betterment accounts using their username and password. Our planning integrations do not include tax lots and cost basis data. Can my firm access our raw data feed? Yes, in addition to publishing your firm’s data to our integration partners, we can also provide your firm with the raw files via SFTP. If you would like to receive the raw files please contact us at support@bettermentforadvisors.com. How long does it take to enable my data feed? It can take up to 4-5 business days. How do I get my data into my portfolio management system? If your firm uses a system we integrate with, please email support@bettermentforadvisors.com and let us know if you’d like integration enabled. Once the integration is enabled we will email you to confirm. Please note it can take several days for the integration to be completed after your request. How do clients automatically import their tax information into tax preparation software? Betterment has connected with TurboTax, H&amp;R Block, and TaxACT tax preparation software to allow automatic import of your tax information. You or your clients will need to search for “Betterment” in order to import their tax information, and can refer to this FAQ for client-facing guidance. Please refer to each provider’s documentation about the steps necessary to import data. Important: If clients have multiple accounts, e.g. personal account and a trust, they will not be able to use TaxACT’s automatic import tool. However, clients can download and import their tax statement CSV, found on the Activity page of their accounts, directly into TaxACT. Please note that while Betterment has provided the tax information in the format specified by the tax preparation software providers, we do not manage the software itself. If you or your clients are experiencing issues with the tax import software of one of these providers, we encourage you or your clients to contact the providers directly. My clients’ tax preparation software has a limit on the number of transactions it supports. How can I use it to report all transactions? Certain versions of tax preparation software have a limit on the number of transaction lines they support for automatic upload. If clients encounter this scenario and are unable to automatically import tax forms, the IRS allows clients to report the summary information on their electronic tax return and send a paper copy of their statement with Form 8453 to the IRS after the tax return has been accepted. For more information, see&nbsp;www.irs.gov/uac/About-Form-8453. Please note that Betterment is not a tax advisor and the information provided should not be construed as tax advice but should be used for informational purposes only. Please consult a qualified tax professional or the IRS to determine the rules that apply to your individual tax situation.

      FAQ: Advisor Dashboard &amp; Reporting Sep 23, 2022 12:00:00 AM Frequently asked questions about the Advisor Dashboard and Reporting Does each advisor have their own dashboard? Yes, each advisor within your firm has their own account and dashboard that provides access to manage their clients’ accounts. Each client that signs up for an account is linked to one advisor within your firm. Can advisors share a household or client with other advisors?

Here you'll need to select the IRA type desired for this client. &nbsp; Can I add a trust account on behalf of my client? Advisors are able to add a trust account for any existing client with just a few clicks.

The system will automatically execute trades in a tax minimizing manner to reach the new target allocation. Am I able to access information related to my clients’ accounts on the platform?

We use a standard time-weighted return to calculate percentage returns for each goal on the Summary page, and to display returns over time on the Performance page. This return can be thought of as the amount one dollar would have changed if it was invested at the same time as a first deposit. The time-weighted return is unaffected by deposits to and withdrawals from an account, and allows for easy assessment of clients’ investments, and a fair comparison with other investments. Is performance data generated on the platform? Yes, performance reporting is embedded on the client interface. Performance reporting for all client portfolios on the platform is available and the user can select the period of time in question. Additionally, daily performance is also included. Advisors are able to view performance data for all client accounts through the impersonation feature on the advisor dashboard. How are statements sent to my clients? Can I access these statements as well? If so, how? Statements are automatically loaded to your clients’ portals. We also send your clients an email once their statements are ready. You can access your clients’ statements via the impersonation feature on the advisor dashboard. On the “Summary” page, select the “Log in” button next to the client that you want to view statements for. Once logged in as the client, select the “Documents” tab. A full archive of your client’s statements is available on the “Statements” sub-tab. Does Betterment for Advisors generate the tax forms for my clients’ accounts? Yes, tax forms for your clients are automatically imported to their client portals. We will also notify your clients via email when these are ready. Where do clients find tax forms if they have multiple accounts, e.g. a personal account and a trust account? Tax forms are available on the Documents page for each account a client holds on the “Taxes” sub-tab. If clients have multiple accounts, they will need to visit the Documents page for each separate account in order to download their respective tax forms. Where can I find my clients’ 5498 tax forms? When will they be available? Your clients will receive a 5498 form if they had an IRA with a non-zero balance in the tax year that just concluded. This form reports all of the IRA contributions for the previous tax year, including rollovers. The information on the 5498 form will also be reported to the IRS. The 5498 tax form can be found on the Taxes page within the Advisor Dashboard. Select your client's name then click "Taxes". You may also access it via the Documents page in the client portal. Generally this form will be made available each May for the prior year, after the April 15 tax filing deadline. When will clients' tax forms be available? Your clients’ 1099 tax forms are automatically imported to their client portals in mid-February, in both CSV and PDF formats. We will notify them via email when these are ready. The forms are not available prior to February due to the 30-day window related to certain TLH+ requirements, which carry through the end of January. Additionally, we need final confirmations on distributions from fund providers regarding their dividend payout classifications. Betterment strives to provide tax forms well in advance of the deadline when possible. Are the monthly statements co-branded with my firm’s brand? Yes, monthly statements are co-branded with your firm’s brand. What information appears on my clients’ statements?

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Common Questions about Billing Your Clients Sep 23, 2022 12:00:00 AM Get answers to your key questions about billing clients. What billing options are available to my firm? The Betterment for Advisors platform includes a “Billing” page visible to the admin(s) of your firm. This page offers three billing options: Asset-Based Billing, Fixed Fee Billing, Tiered Billing. Learn more about each in our article. How often are my clients billed? Firm admins can select whether to bill clients on a monthly or a quarterly basis.&nbsp; Any changes made will take effect at the start of the next quarter, though a pending change can be cancelled or modified up until that date.&nbsp; All advisors of the firm will be sent a reminder that their firm’s billing frequency is about to change about one week before it goes into effect. How often does Betterment pay me the fees collected on my behalf? Betterment will remit payment to your firm on the same frequency that we collect from your clients, per your discretion.&nbsp; If your firm has elected to bill clients monthly, Betterment will send payment in the first two weeks of each month.&nbsp; If your firm has elected to bill clients quarterly, Betterment will send payment in the first two weeks of each quarter.&nbsp; Firm admins must supply bank account information in&nbsp;Firm settings to receive payments. How are billing plans created? Any admin(s) of your firm will be able to create a new billing plan by following the steps below: Log onto the&nbsp;advisor dashboard Click Client Billing, located in the menu on the left In the top right, select “Create a billing plan” Enter a unique name for the new billing plan and select the billing plan type. (See below for specific billing plan types) How are billing plans applied? The advisor of a household will be able to do this by following the steps below: Log onto the&nbsp;advisor dashboard&nbsp; Click Clients, located in the menu on the left Search for and click the name of the household whose pricing should be updated Select Settings and click the “Edit” button corresponding to “Household Billing Plan” Choose one plan from the list displayed and click Update Plan If a different pricing plan is needed, contact an admin of the firm so they may create it How is the default billing plan of the firm updated? Any admin(s) of your firm will be able to update the default billing plan of the firm by following the steps below: Log onto the&nbsp;advisor dashboard&nbsp; Click Billing, located in the menu on the left The current default billing plan will be at the top of the list, click Edit to make changes If needed, modify the name for the plan and select the billing plan type. (See below for specific billing plan types) How to create or edit Tiered Billing Plans: Once on the “Tiered billing plan” page, use the “Firm fee” column and click on “Asset based” or “Fixed” to switch between the two. Enter the number of basis points (bps) or dollars that should be charged for the first tier of invested assets. If more than one tier is needed, click “+ Add tier” then enter the high range value for the previous tier. Repeat these steps for each tier needed. If this is not a new billing plan, the next page will display the households that will be impacted. Scroll to the bottom to click “Update billing plan.” How to create or edit Fixed Billing Plans: Once on the “Fixed Billing Plan” page, use the “Firm fee” field to type in the dollar value you’d like this plan to assess on client accounts annually. No need to type in a dollar sign, only enter the digits and a decimal if you will be charging in cents as well. If this is not a new billing plan, the next page will display the households that will be impacted. Scroll to the bottom to click “Update billing plan.” How to create or edit Asset Based Billing Plans: Once on the “Edit Asset Based Billing Plan” page, use the “Spread bps” field to type in the number of basis points you’d like charged by this billing plan. For example, for a fee of %0.50 type in 50. When satisfied with the new spread, click Save changes. If this is not a new billing plan, the next page will display the households that will be impacted. Scroll to the bottom to click “Update billing plan.” How to change the Billing Plan for groups of clients: The Client Billing page, accessible&nbsp; to admins of your firm, will display one row per existing billing plan. The row includes an “Assigned to” column. This displays the numbers of clients on this billing plan. To adjust the billing plan applicable to this group of clients the admin of your firm will be able to follow the steps below: Click Edit to make changes If needed, modify the name for the plan and select the billing plan type then click continue. How do I update a client's fees?

How do I get paid for the client accounts that I manage on the platform? Betterment for Advisors operates a fee-only platform. Firm admins may create multiple billing plans using Asset Based Billing, Fixed Billing, or Tiered Billing. The billing plan applied to a client's household will, by default, include Betterment's platform fee. Aggregate fees are billed automatically by Betterment from the client’s account quarterly or monthly in arrears, and Betterment subsequently remits the advisor’s fee to the Firm bank account on file. Can I set custom level fees for individual households? Yes, you may utilize Billing Plans to set custom fees for a client's household. If any of the available Billing Plans do not fit your needs, an admin of your firm may create a new customized billing plan that is either Asset Based, Fixed, or Tiered. How are the fees calculated? We accrue fees beginning one day before the end of the prior quarter or month and the accrual of fees ends two days prior to the end of the current quarter or month. The fee is calculated pursuant to the formula [sum of the following for each day in the preceding billing period: (the balance in a client’s account at the end of the day) * (advisory fee applicable on that day)] and will be deducted from the account three days after the transaction date, following the settlement of the trade(s) made to fund the fee. Fees are billed in arrears and the advisor’s portion of the fee is sent to the advisory firm shortly after the end of the quarter or month via ACH. Are fee tiers supported? Yes, we do support fee tiers. Anyone with admin level access to the advisor dashboard may create new billing plan types, including Tiered Billing. Once the plan is created you may apply it at the household level. How are fees reported to my clients? Your clients see the total fee (platform fee + billing plan applied to the household) in their client portal on the “Activity” page and on their monthly statements. You are responsible for providing the fee breakdown between the Betterment platform fee and your advisory firm fee to your clients, though we do make this information viewable within the client’s portal under their “Settings” tab. Are there any trading or transacting costs associated with the Betterment for Advisors platform? No, there are no trading or transaction costs associated with the Betterment for Advisors platform.

    <p class="item-title">FAQ: Security &amp; Privacy</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      FAQ: Security &amp; Privacy Sep 23, 2022 12:00:00 AM Learn more about Betterment's security and privacy policies. How does Betterment’s data aggregation functionality relate to the SEC’s custody rule? Advisers may have access to clients’ financial account login and password information for various reasons, including to rebalance the holdings in those accounts, to pay bills for the client, or to facilitate the aggregation of financial information from multiple accounts. Betterment for Advisors provides the ability for advisers to aggregate client financial accounts on the Betterment platform by entering client login and password information via the impersonation function. Advisers, however, should be aware that possessing client login and password information can, under certain circumstances,&nbsp;be deemed to trigger custody&nbsp;over the assets in those accounts. One way a registered investment adviser could be deemed to have custody of a client’s assets is when the adviser has any authority to&nbsp;obtain possession of those assets. An adviser may decide that it is appropriate to have custody over client assets, but doing so gives rise to additional SEC oversight, including a requirement for an annual surprise audit by an independent accountant at the adviser’s expense. Advisers wishing to help avoid triggering inadvertent custody by using impersonation to aggregate client accounts might wish to consider asking clients to sign&nbsp;written instructions&nbsp;limiting the adviser’s authority to make withdrawals from the accounts before the client provides the adviser with login and password information.&nbsp;There may be other ways to avoid triggering inadvertent custody as well. *Note: No information above is, or should be considered, legal advice. If you believe you need legal advice on the subject above, please consult a lawyer. Can my client add a 'trusted contact' for their account? Your client may want to designate a close friend, family member, or other party 18 years or older who we can contact in the unlikely scenario that we suspect your client is a victim of financial exploitation. If your client chooses to designate a trusted contact, they authorize Betterment Securities to contact the individual to disclose information about their account to address possible financial exploitation, to confirm the specifics of their contact information, health status, or identity of any legal guardian, executor, trustee or holder of a power of attorney, or as otherwise permitted by&nbsp;FINRA Rules 2165 &amp; 4512. Your clients can add this information by selecting the "Settings" tab on the lower left of their client portal. Once on this page, they will be able to scroll down to the bottom of the Trusted Contacts section and input the information. Betterment Securities, as a FINRA registered broker-dealer, is required to provide customers this opportunity. How do you maintain security and privacy? We use industry-standard encryption, store all of our data on servers in secure off-site facilities, and implement systematic processes and procedures for securing and storing data. And because we value your trust, we will protect the privacy of information and will never rent or sell your data or your client’s data with any third party for any purpose without your client’s permission. You can find our privacy policy and security procedures here.

    <p class="item-title">Client Agreement Automation</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Client Agreement Automation Sep 23, 2022 12:00:00 AM Everything you need to know about this great feature. Scroll down to learn more and read our legal disclosures. The Betterment for Advisors Client Agreement Automation function will make onboarding your new clients fast, easy, and completely paperless. By permitting your clients to execute your firm’s advisory agreement as part of the white-labeled Betterment for Advisors signup experience, you automate a manual process, giving you more time to focus on your business while providing your clients with a better experience. How to Get Started To get started, have a firm admin navigate to the&nbsp;Agreements page&nbsp;to upload the following documents: a PDF of the advisory agreement between your firm and your clients, signed by an authorized party at your firm a PDF of your firm’s Form ADV Part 2A a PDF of the advisor’s relevant Form ADV Part 2B, if applicable (see below) a PDF of your firm’s Form CRS a PDF of your firm’s privacy policy Note that an executed advisory agreement is required to use the Client Agreement Automation function, but the Form ADV Part 2A, Form CRS, and Privacy Policy are all optional. Any advisor may upload their ADV Part 2B, independent of the presence of firm-level documents. About the Client Agreement Automation Function The Client Agreement Automation function gives you the option to have your clients electronically execute your firm’s advisory agreement as part of the white-labeled onboarding experience. It also will permit you to provide your Form ADV Part 2A, Form CRS, and privacy policy to your clients at the time of onboarding. Additionally, each advisor on the platform may supply their Form ADV Part 2B if they choose to do so.&nbsp; This will be presented to their clients at the time of onboarding alongside the other documents that may be supplied at the firm level. Provision of the Form ADV Part 2B is optional, and can be implemented even if your firm does not supply any of the other agreements or disclosures. Use of the Client Agreement Automation function is optional. If you choose not to use the function or to provide only a subset of your firm documents, you will need to separately execute your agreements between your firm and your clients and deliver firm disclosures in a manner determined by you outside of the Betterment for Advisors platform. The Client Agreement Automation function is only intended to assist firms in presenting agreements and disclosures associated with account openings. Subsequent updates to these documents are not re-delivered to existing clients; the firm must make their own arrangements to deliver any such updates. Contact us with questions at&nbsp;support@bettermentforadvisors.com. How It Works Overview: The Client Agreement Automation allows your firm to provide a form advisor agreement, Form ADV Part 2A, Form ADV Part 2B, Form CRS and privacy policy to Betterment, which Betterment will then host. As part of the Betterment for Advisors client signup, Betterment will electronically deliver these documents to your clients and permit your clients to click a checkbox indicating their consent to your firm’s form advisory agreement. You have the option of providing only a subset of the documents listed above, though you must provide an advisory agreement to use this function. Only those documents which you upload to your firm dashboard will be provided to clients. Signup:&nbsp;As part of the Betterment for Advisors electronic signup process, your clients are presented with agreements between them and Betterment, and acknowledge receipt of Betterment’s disclosure documents. If you elect to use the Client Agreement Automation function, your clients are also presented with your firm’s advisory agreement and any disclosure documents you have uploaded as of the date each client signs up. This allows the client to execute and/or acknowledge these documents all at once, rather than separately. Your client electronically consents to the terms of these agreements by checking a checkbox and clicking a button to agree to create their account.&nbsp; Please note that Betterment does not collect traditional handwritten signatures for either your agreement or the Betterment for Advisors agreements. Instead, consent is indicated via mouse click or other electronic method of input, and the date and time of such consent is recorded and stored. Records: In the advisor dashboard, under the “Agreements” tab, each advisor can view which of their clients executed the firm’s agreement electronically, the date and time at which they executed the agreement, and a digital copy of the version they executed (along with the versions of the firm’s Form ADV Part 2A, Form CRS and privacy policy, and the advisor’s Form ADV Part 2B, provided these documents were uploaded at the time the client was onboarded). &nbsp; This table is your record that your client executed your agreement electronically. Note that you can view and download the agreement by clicking the “Agreements Package” button on the right of the table. Copies of Form ADV Part 2B will appear alongside the agreements package if one was present at time of signup. A similar page is provided to Compliance users in the Compliance page in the Betterment for Advisors platform, allowing those with the Compliance permissions to view all of the firm’s clients and their agreements. Important Considerations for Your Firm Please review these items carefully before deciding whether or not to use the Client Agreement Automation function. One of each type of document per firm:&nbsp;The Client Agreement Automation function only supports one of each type of document per firm at a time, meaning one advisory agreement, one Form ADV Part 2A, one Form CRS, and one privacy policy at a time. You may change that agreement by having a firm admin upload a new copy of the agreement via the Agreements section of the Betterment for Advisors web portal. Once a new form of agreement is uploaded, this new form will be presented to all new clients who sign up in the future, but it will not be presented or distributed to existing clients. Form ADV Part 2B:&nbsp;Each individual advisor on the platform may upload their own ADV Part 2B if they choose or if their firm directs them to do so. If a Form ADV Part 2B is present when a client signs up, a record of the acknowledgement of receipt of the Form ADV Part 2B and a copy thereof will be presented on the Agreements page as well as in the Compliance view, alongside firm-level agreements (if supplied). Form CRS: When present, the Firm’s Form CRS will be shown as the first disclosure alongside the other documents and disclosures during client onboarding that are a part of the Agreements Automation Service. In addition to client onboarding, the Firm’s Form CRS is presented to clients when adding additional services. Additional services when the Firm’s Form CRS will be presented include when the client opens a new type of account, on the client consent form when the advisor initiates the opening of a new type of account, when a rollover is initiated by a client, on the client consent form when the advisor initiates a rollover, on quarterly statement notifications, and when a user logs in for the first time since the Firm has uploaded or updated their Form CRS. Examples of opening a new type of account include, when a client with a taxable investing account opens an individual retirement account or when a client with an individual retirement account opens a joint account. Fee changes:&nbsp;When considering whether to use the Client Agreement Automation function, you should take into account that advisors have the ability to change the fees they charge specific clients in the advisor dashboard (subject to available Billing Plans, which can only be created by firm admins.) Before using the function, you should determine how, if at all, this impacts the structure of your agreements. Always on:&nbsp;If you decide to use the Client Agreement Automation function, it will be turned on for all of the clients that you bring to Betterment for Advisors. This means that all clients you bring to Betterment for Advisors will have to execute the agreement you provided to Betterment as part of the signup process. Multiple signatories:&nbsp;Currently, the Client Agreement Automation function does not support accounts with multiple signatories, such as trusts with multiple trustees and joint accounts. Agreement amendments: While agreements can be updated and will go live for future client onboarding, we do not support amendments to your agreements with existing clients on our system. If you would like to amend your agreement with some of your clients, you will need to do so yourself, using whatever non-Betterment mechanism and recordkeeping system you deem appropriate. Form ADV Part 2A, Form CRS and privacy disclosure updates: While Form ADV Part 2A and Form CRS can be updated and will go live for subsequent client onboarding, we will not send any updates to your Form ADV Part 2A, Form CRS, or privacy disclosures to your existing clients. You are responsible for complying with SEC rules governing when and how to deliver any required disclosures and amendments to these documents to your clients.

      FAQ: Custom Portfolios for Advisors Sep 23, 2022 12:00:00 AM Build your own custom model portfolios of ETF funds while leveraging all of Betterment’s sophisticated portfolio management features. What are custom model portfolios? The Betterment for Advisors platform allows advisors to customize portfolios of almost any ETFs, while maintaining access to Betterment’s suite of automated features including: automated rebalancing tax-loss harvesting asset location / tax coordinated portfolios tax-optimized sales for withdrawals glide path rebalancing and more How do I create custom model portfolios for my clients? To get started, log into your dashboard and navigate to Portfolios &gt; Create a portfolio &gt; Custom portfolio. Follow the prompts in the module to create securities groups, determine risk levels for your portfolio, and more. How is this program different from Flexible Portfolios? Previous functionality allowed advisors to customize portfolios using ETFs that are part of the Betterment Core Portfolio Strategy. Now, advisors can use almost any ETF (as long as there is sufficient liquidity and trading volume). Also, custom model portfolios are now eligible for tax-efficient automated features like Tax Loss Harvesting (TLH+) and Tax Coordinated Portfolios (TCP). What are the program requirements? There are no asset minimums or additional fees required to build custom portfolios. I have more questions - who can I talk to and where can I learn more? Please fill out this form, and our team will follow up with you. Security Selection: What securities are supported? Only ETFs are supported at this time. Mutual funds, single stocks, and other securities are not available. What ETFs are supported? Almost all ETFs are supported, as long as there is sufficient liquidity and trading volume. How many different asset allocations can be included in one portfolio? For each custom portfolio, firms can define anywhere from 1 to 25 asset allocations. Betterment Automated Features: What is Tax Loss Harvesting (TLH+)? How does this feature work with custom model portfolios? Tax loss harvesting is the practice of selling a security that has experienced a loss—and then buying a similar asset to replace it. The switch does two things: it allows the investor to realize, or “harvest”, a valuable loss while keeping the portfolio balanced at the desired allocation. Capital losses can lower your clients’ tax bill by offsetting gains and reducing ordinary taxable income up to $3000 per year. The custom model portfolios program allows firms to designate a primary, secondary, and IRA secondary ETF ticker for each asset class to be used for TLH+. Tax Loss Harvesting+ may not be suitable for all investors. For more information, please see our full disclosure here. How does Tax Coordination work? Tax Coordination is designed for investors who are saving for retirement in more than one type of account, including taxable accounts, traditional IRAs, or Roth IRAs generally with the same time horizon. Once you set it up, Betterment will look across all of the accounts grouped under retirement and automatically reorganize which assets are held in which accounts. Of these three types of accounts, each are taxed differently: (1) taxable accounts, (2) traditional IRAs or 401(k)s, and (3) Roth IRAs or 401(k)s. With Tax-Coordination, the assets are then arranged (unequally) across all coordinated accounts to maximize the after-tax performance of the overall portfolio. We do this in a way that keeps the overall allocation the same while boosting after-tax returns. We've outlined the potential benefits of Tax Coordination and some reasons you may not want to use it here. For more information on our estimates and Tax Coordination generally, see full disclosure here. How does Betterment rebalance client portfolios? How does automated rebalancing work? More information about Betterment's automated rebalancing feature is available here. What capital market assumptions are used for balance and spending power projections? Firms can input their own capital market assumptions, or Betterment's team can provide assumptions.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      How to Be a Successful Financial Advisor: 8 Tips Aug 17, 2022 11:58:36 AM Success doesn't happen overnight, but following these tips can help speed up the process (and avoid key pitfalls). Finding success in any profession is one of life's great joys. Yet, it can be hard to identify the necessary milestones in your own journey that add up to the definition of success. As we'll discuss in this article, "success" is the outcome of a million little decisions and actions over time. As an advisor, you can attest to the reality that most clients have financial baggage. If you were advising me, you'd see pretty quickly that my career in personal finance is a strong reaction to growing up without money. We all have something driving us and, for me, it’s a crippling fear of living without financial stability. Luckily, our past experience can be used for good if we acknowledge the role it plays in our decision-making. For me, that fear created an unwillingness to do the wrong thing once the right thing becomes obvious, which led me to co-founding and scaling a fee-only RIA before ultimately selling to a larger firm. Today, I bring that experience to Betterment for Advisors, where I consult with our clients about the ways that they can use our tools to make them more successful as they build and grow their practices. If there is one lesson that I would impart to a financial advisor who is asking themselves how to become more successful at what they do, the simplest and most succinct advice I can give is to have vision. In other words, the best place to start is with an articulated vision of your ideal future—from there, you can work backwards to identify your next step in that journey. But that can be easier said than done! So, let's consider a few ways to chip away at getting there with 8 day-to-day tips that'll set you down the right path. But first – what does it mean to be a successful financial advisor? When you ask yourself What does a successful financial advisor look like?, there might be a few categories that come to mind. We all know that financial advice is about merging qualitative with the quantitative and that's true when finding success, too! First, we consider marking success for an advisor by the science—AUM, the number of clients you serve, or even the size of your staff. But in reality, all of these are extrinsic motivators. Meaning, they are markers of success to others looking in. The other side of success, and perhaps the more important side, is more intrinsically motivated—because success only means something if you feel successful yourself. And often, as advisors, we find this in the relationships we build with our clients. To be a successful financial advisor, I believe a few key traits are required. Five traits of a successful financial advisor Be accountable The first trait of a successful financial advisor is accountability. In order to be a successful financial advisor, you have to be accountable to your clients and therefore, hold yourself accountable for their success. Anyone can make suggestions to a friend about what to do with their money, or anyone can read a Reddit thread about trends in personal finance. But the difference for a client working with a financial advisor is that they have a partner with whom they can entrust their financial futures and know they have their best interest at heart. Seek empathy The second most important trait is empathy. Advisors are often present for the most momentous times in a client's life—marriage, having a child, buying a house, caring for an ill or elderly family member, losing a loved one. So, practicing empathy and really meeting clients where they're at emotionally can mark the difference between a good and a great financial advisor. Advisors are people, too. Make a practice of sharing personal anecdotes and mistakes you've made in the past with your clients. This will give them permission to relax and trust you more quickly. Stay curious Curiosity is also key. Often, getting at a client's financial goals can be tough. Asking a simple question like What are your goals? can lead to simple answers, but when you dig in, every person's vision for their future or financial fears has a ton of nuance. Separately, staying curious when exploring new investment vehicles is also crucial. When, for example, Crypto became a newsworthy asset class, the curious advisor is more poised to look into and learn about the asset’s complexities in order to give the best advice to their clients. Be intentional A successful financial advisor is also intentional with their time and energy. Not only can you have various clients vying for your time and attention, but your personal life can also take a back seat when you build such strong and deeply personal relationships with your clients. Remember that burnout helps no one! To be in it for the long haul, advisors need to learn how to best dedicate their time to specific clients, tasks, and, ultimately, aspects of their lives. Teach! Finally, the best advisors are also teachers. Learning about the ins and outs of their money movements often brings clients comfort and ultimately establishes trust. Similarly, in order to scale a successful practice, a strong advisor needs to also impart their practices and philosophies onto their employees. The better an advisor can constantly be teaching (and learning!), the more successful they will be. I'm all of these things – what's next? So, you nailed the art of being a great advisor and you've found some success, but now you've got a firm that you are trying to scale and grow. Next up, let me share 8 tips for building a successful practice. Tips for building a successful practice Automate more processes to save time If you want to optimize the hours in your day, automate! Tolls on the road to success are paid with time, but there's never been a better time to build an efficient financial planning practice. With the right tools, data collection and analysis, portfolio management, and even scheduling can all be completely automated at a minimal cost. Anything that doesn't need to be done by a human should be done with technology. Craft a scheduling system that you can stick to Take being intentional with your time to the next level. Live and die by your calendar. Seriously. This is the most precious tool you have in your toolbelt. Make a habit of looking at your calendar every morning and filling every empty time slot with something intentional. Schedule time to read, schedule time to eat lunch, schedule time to write blogs or social media posts – and then actually do it. Don't waste the time you have or fall victim to distraction as a result of no direction. Avoid the temptation to hire help too early I've seen too many advisors (myself included!) find success early and hire too quickly because they believe their time is too valuable for mundane tasks. Well, it is, but hiring someone shouldn't be your first instinct because… technology! Spend some valuable time researching technology solutions that cost less than a full-time person and increase efficiencies before hiring help. Your time is certainly worth money, but make sure that you are truly out of time before you buy more. Plus, hiring, onboarding, and training can often take up more of your time for at least six months before that investment pays off. As you hire, make sure you have enough time to make that person successful and, if you don't, see how technology might be able to help instead. Embrace rejection Timing is everything. "No" often has nothing to do with you and everything to do with that prospect's individual circumstances or past experiences. The key isn't just about getting "yesses," but getting a "yes" or "no" from every prospect as quickly as possible. And you will hear "no" more than "yes"—that's just the nature of our business. But nothing is worse than ambivalence or inaction. Don’t focus on the decision the prospect makes, but rather your ability to bring them to a resolution. Remember that you are an expert Even if you're just getting started in your career, recognize that the prospect or client is seeking your counsel because they know less about financial planning than you do. Let that empower you, because you just might be the most important voice in their financial life. Look to industry leaders and peers you admire for advice Once you know what success looks like for you, find people who are already there and kindly ask for some of their time. The best thing you can do is learn from those who have the things you want. In addition, schedule time to read and avoid the temptation to use that time for other things. This is an area where social media can be a great networking tool. While Twitter, for instance, can certainly be a black hole of distractions, there are an exceptional number of amazing business leaders sharing information on the platform every day. Avoid decision paralysis when you can As advisors, it's our nature to analyze every decision. But when it comes to building a business, you'll find that the formula is actually "ready, fire, aim." Today is about action—you'll have plenty of time to refine your practice tomorrow. Think of your practice as a "daily driver" Identify your ideal client's needs, and structure your tech stack, client service model and fee structure, in such a way that it gets you from point A to point B with that ideal client as quickly and efficiently as possible. Do not waste time building solutions for the 10% of clients who do not fit your focus. Now, go out there and go get 'em! Unfortunately, there is no repeatable recipe for success. Not only does success look different for everyone, but getting there is an undeniable combination of hard work, good timing, and a little bit of luck. What you can do is focus on the things you can control—your actions and commitment to the process.

    <p class="item-title">"What Do You Do?": Compelling Value Propositions for Financial Advisors</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      "What Do You Do?": Compelling Value Propositions for Financial Advisors Aug 4, 2022 1:04:31 PM As your advisory practice grows, you will find yourself having more and more conversations about what it is you do. These conversations are key to growing your network, your client base, and ultimately your business, so it’s important that you can describe your practice clearly, confidently, and concisely. If you can articulate the value you bring to the table, and if you can do so in a way that differentiates you from your competition, these conversations become much easier. Plus, it makes your marketing efforts more effective, from designing your business cards to writing your website copy. In this guide, we will look at examples of how to articulate your value proposition as a financial advisor (answering the question, “What do you do?”), as well as how to form your unique selling proposition (answering the question, “Why should I work with you, specifically?”). Value propositions for financial advisors A value proposition is a simple statement of what you provide to your clients. Most companies have a generic value proposition built into their business category. For example: Grocery stores provide value to consumers by giving them a single place to buy different types of packaged goods in consumer quantities. (Otherwise, people would have to create relationships with dairies, produce providers, and large CPG brands themselves.) Dentists provide value to patients by cleaning and inspecting mouths in ways that consumers wouldn’t otherwise have the means, equipment, and expertise to do. Law offices provide value to clients by renting out their knowledge of law and policy, saving clients the time and effort of learning to practice law (and avoiding the costs of accidentally handling things illegally). Likewise, in the financial advice space, the value you provide to your clients comes from several generic sources. These sources fall into two major buckets: financial value and extra-financial value. Financial value vs. extra-financial value Financial value is the most straightforward benefit you provide. It simply refers to the ROI that your clients realize through working with you. This includes generating returns, avoiding losses, managing and optimizing deposit limits, etc. Extra-financial value is more expansive. This refers to all the “extra” benefits that someone enjoys besides the ROI—it’s what some financial advisors have begun to refer to as ROL, or “return on life.” This includes value sources such as: Planning: objectively envisioning what your clients can accomplish. Your clients can be inspired to change their investing, spending, and saving habits simply because you helped them set a vision and make a plan to realize it. This can create feelings of confidence and security that could be difficult to come by otherwise. Organization: helping your clients know if they’re on track. By organizing your clients’ financial lives, you give them the assurance that at any point in time, they can quickly check in to see if they’re on track to meet their goals. You also make it much easier for them to access information they need for tax reporting, estate planning, and other wealth management activities. Accountability: keeping your clients on track. Just like a personal trainer holds their clients accountable for reaching their fitness goals, you’re the voice that reminds and encourages your clients to work toward their financial goals. Expertise: educating and counseling your clients. You’re the financial expert, so your clients don’t need to stay abreast of the stock market, monetary policy, fiscal policy, inflation, and the like if they don’t want to. Instead, you keep them informed on what they need to know, and you’re available to educate them on what they want to know. Almost every financial advisory practice will provide value through a blend of what we’ve listed above. However, that blend will vary from advisor to advisor. Some advisors will be stronger at building tailored plans, while others will focus more on client education. So while all advisors more or less provide value from the same sources, individual value propositions will vary from practice to practice. How to write your value proposition Writing a value proposition should be a simple process. The statement doesn’t need to be fancy, and it can be as long or brief as you want. But some criteria separate a useful value proposition from a useless one: It should be easy for your audience to understand. Unless your target market is the extremely financially literate, you should avoid technical in-speak. It should be easy for you to remember. Although you can use your value proposition for multiple marketing purposes (more on that later), your value proposition will help you most if it can simply answer the question, “What do you do?” As an RIA, you don’t want to come up with a new answer to that question every time someone asks it. Your value proposition should be your immediate, go-to response. It should sound natural. Don’t treat your value proposition like a composition assignment. Use words that you would use in a regular conversation. Instead of “I optimize and organize my clients’ portfolios so as to maximize return on investment and realize their financial goals,” you might try, “I help people set financial goals, get their finances in order, and keep them on track for reaching their goals.” It should be verifiable. If someone asks you if you have examples or if they ask how your offerings work, you should be able to naturally bring up real-life scenarios that explain or illustrate the value you provide. Example value propositions for financial advisors Your value proposition needs to communicate the benefit you provide to your clients and how you provide that value. Here are some example value propositions: “I help people get their financial lives in order: I manage their investments so that their money is working toward their long-term goals without them needing to worry about it.” “I’m like a counselor, but I focus on people’s finances. I keep my clients educated on how the market works and help them make objective decisions with their money.” “I keep people on track with their financial goals: my clients and I work together to set expectations and milestones, and I help them keep their eye on the long-term.” Ways to use your value proposition As we’ve discussed, your value proposition can be helpful primarily when describing what you do in conversations—especially in the early years of your practice. However, your value proposition will come in handy when: Creating marketing collateral. Your business cards, your letterhead, your email signature, bios and descriptions for community events and sponsorships, your Google My Business description—all the little bits of text you may need to write to describe your business become easier to create when you’ve already articulated what you do. Crafting your social profiles. Your LinkedIn profile, Facebook page, Instagram account—all the places where you describe yourself can benefit from already having articulated your value proposition. Onboarding clients. When you bring a new client in for that first meeting, your value proposition can function as an outline for the ground you need to cover. This will help you set expectations for your client and make sure they are aware of all the services you provide. Organizing your website. If you have articulated what you do, then deciding what pages and content you need on your website becomes much easier. A comprehensive value proposition can be a good starting point for mapping out the content and navigation for your website. Onboarding employees. If you’re ready to hire new talent, your value proposition can be a vital tool for giving new employees an idea of your firm’s goals and what they will be helping your clients accomplish. (Plus, it will help them answer the question, “What do you do?” when it comes up—amplifying your word-of-mouth marketing efforts.) Articulating a unique selling proposition. You’re not the only financial advisor in your market, and knowing what you do is the starting point for explaining why someone should choose to hire you instead of the competition. This last part is important, because a value proposition is just a start when it comes to communicating your value as a financial advisor. Once you have your value proposition articulated, you will want to move on to writing your unique selling proposition. Unique selling propositions for financial advisors While a value proposition describes how your practice creates value, the unique selling proposition makes the case for why you’re the right advisor for your target market. Value propositions are descriptive; unique selling propositions are persuasive. The unique selling proposition (which marketers usually shorten to “USP”) is typically a one-or two-sentence statement that should accomplish the following: Resonate with your target market’s emotions. The USP should involve an emotional appeal: you want to tap into how your most satisfied clients feel (or how you want your future clients to feel). Differentiate you from “the rest” of the financial advisors. This doesn’t need to be a unique product offering. But your unique flavor should be evident when people read or hear your USP. If you focus on helping… people in a certain profession (e.g., medical professionals), or people from a certain background (e.g., first- and second-generation immigrants), or people with certain like-minded values or practices (e.g., homeschooling families), or people facing certain challenges (e.g., newly divorced parents) … … then this should be evident in your USP. It could even come down to a different tone or energy that you bring to your client meetings (e.g., you might be the humorous, nerdy, and/or outdoorsy FA in your city). Plainly state how you help your clients. Your USP should highlight the value you bring to your target audience. This is much easier to do after you have developed your general value proposition. How to use your unique selling proposition Developing your USP can be beneficial for fleshing out your marketing strategy. It bridges the gap between what you do and why people choose to work with you. Once your USP is written, you can use it in various ways: Website homepage copy. It can be tough to figure out exactly what to say on the homepage of your website—but if you have already articulated your unique selling proposition, most of the work is done. Your website homepage is the perfect place for your USP to live: it immediately tells your website visitors who you serve, what they can expect, and why they should choose you. Networking with competitors. Unless you are the only financial advisor in your community, you will likely find yourself at networking events with other advisors. If you know what separates you from the rest of the pack, then networking becomes a bit easier. Not only can you naturally differentiate yourself from the other advisors, but you can also differentiate yourself to the other advisors. It’s easier to converse with and learn from other people in your field if they know you’re not chasing their target audience. Advertising copy. Should you start spending money on ads, your USP will help you target your spending on the right audience. It can also increase your return on ad spend, as you won’t be advertising generic services—you’ll be promoting something uniquely appealing. Grow your advisory business with Betterment Your value proposition and USP are two key tools you can use to grow your business. By articulating what you do and why people should choose you, you give yourself an advantage in both your everyday conversations and your marketing efforts. But this degree of intentionality can take time. And processing the demand that comes with effective communication takes even more time. One way to optimize your time as you grow your advisory practice is to invest in tools that reduce hours spent on investment management and back-office admin. If you’re looking for a better way to grow your business, Betterment for Advisors can help. Our platform helps you deliver personalized model portfolios to your clients and manage your entire practice—which means you can spend more time crafting your message, building relationships, and bringing in new clients.

    <p class="item-title">5 Tips to Give to Inexperienced Investors During A Market Dip</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      5 Tips to Give to Inexperienced Investors During A Market Dip Jul 18, 2022 2:20:00 PM If your clients are first-time investors, helping them make that initial deposit and setting up their portfolios can be difficult. During a market dip? Even more so. Here are 5 talking points to help you communicate with inexperienced investors in times of volatility. Investing money for the first time may make your clients feel like they're diving into the deep end of the pool. It can be even more nerve-wracking when market conditions are choppy. If they ultimately decide they're ready, here are 5 tips for helping new investors get started during a market downturn. 1. "Have an emergency fund." Talking about emergency planning can be a great way to get new investors comfortable with the idea of investing. Help your client set about 3 to 6 months worth of expenses and recurring payments aside to build an emergency fund held in a cash account or a low-risk investment portfolio. Having this safety net will give your client the confidence to invest the rest of their money more aggressively—and with less worry. 2. "Invest at your own pace." Lump sum investing allows clients to optimize their money immediately in an appropriate portfolio strategy based on their specific goals and time horizon. Although this approach may generate a better investment outcome over the long term, inexperienced investors can be hesitant. Your more risk averse clients may prefer to dollar-cost average, spreading out risk during volatile market periods. Another approach that may make clients feel more comfortable is to invest a little bit at a time. One of the best ways to do this is by helping your clients set up an auto-deposit schedule where they choose the investment amount (i.e., $300) and frequency (i.e., monthly). By setting their own pace, your client can feel more secure moving forward. 3. "Focus on your time horizon." Remind your clients that not all of their investments need to have the same risk level.&nbsp; Your clients are likely investing for multiple financial goals at the same time, such as a home down payment, future college expenses, or retirement. Each of these financial goals likely has a different time horizon and should be invested accordingly. Breaking your clients’ investments into goals allows you to better control their risk and build a personalized investing plan. It can also make less experienced investors feel more comfortable with the level of risk they are taking on in proportion to how soon they’ll need to access a particular bucket of money. Betterment for Advisors' powerful portfolio-building tools enable you to serve your clients' needs and investing preferences. Our tooling automates rebalancing, tax-loss harvesting, deposits, and more, so you can more efficiently manage your clients' plans. 4. "Pay attention to historical context." As a new investor, your client may not have much context or know what to expect in terms of performance.&nbsp; It can be helpful to let clients know that many others before them have felt nervous about markets. From 1942 to 2022, the U.S. has been through 15 bear markets. On average, bear markets last for about 11.3 months, which tend to be significantly shorter than bull markets which last 4.4 years on average. Remind them that, after each of the past downturns, the stock market often recovers. You should make sure clients understand that there have been many market dips in the past, and they will likely see many more in the future. They are an inescapable part of investing and all investors, new and old, should learn to cope with volatility.&nbsp; Though your clients may be tempted to make major withdrawals or even halt their auto-deposits when the market dives, remind them that now is the time to stay the course. History shows us that the market, and their portfolio, can recover. 5. "Focus on what you can control." Your clients can't control the stock market. They also can't control the news, inflation, GDP growth, or unemployment rates.&nbsp; However, they can control how much they save, how much risk they take, how diversified they are, and how they react when markets get scary. In the long run, push your clients to focus on what they can control, and encourage them to do their best to ignore what they can't. New investors should not be discouraged by market dips. At Betterment, our passive investing model is derived from the idea that taking action solely based on market movement can be detrimental—contrary to what your clients might think. Ultimately, being thoughtful about your clients' finances and overall risk in their portfolios during market uncertainty can help them weather the storm, no matter how long the downturn lasts. When volatility hits, rest assured that we are working for your clients. Our automatic allocation adjustments, portfolio rebalancing, and tax-loss harvesting can help your clients ride out a choppy market. &nbsp;

      Advisor Spotlight: Eric Rodriguez, WealthBuilders Mar 14, 2022 12:03:00 PM For this Advisor Spotlight, we welcome Eric Rodriguez, CFP® and the Founder of WealthBuilders, LLC to chat about taking a more life-centered approach to financial planning. Advisor: Eric Rodriguez Firm: WealthBuilders, LLC Bio: Eric is a Certified Financial Planner® and the Founder of WealthBuilders, LLC, an independent, virtual RIA based out of San Diego, CA. Eric is the author of R.E.T.I.R.E. On Your Terms: 6 Steps To Build Wealth and Co-Host of The Avocado Toast Podcast. He started his career as a registered rep for a broker-dealer that was heavily focused on product sales. That firm left him with a bad impression of the financial industry, so he switched careers to strategic B2B sales where he thrived. About eight years later, Eric was introduced to real financial planning when he started working at LearnVest. He was inspired to launch his own firm, WealthBuilders LLC, in 2017. Firm Bio: WealthBuilders is an independent fee-only fiduciary wealth management firm. WealthBuilders specializes in working with progressive early to mid-career professionals and business owners who are passionate about aligning their wealth with their values. Why did you decide to become an advisor? My parents didn’t talk about money growing up. They argued about it. I wanted to change that for us. I wanted to normalize talking about money and building wealth, and I wanted to make it a positive experience. This is what inspired me to become a CFP®. What are some questions that you wish more clients would ask? How do you measure success with your clients? Why? What do you think is the biggest mistake people make with their money? Not having a customized wealth plan that aligns their key values with their money. Having a wealth plan that includes a vision for your ideal future, key values, the unexpected, and goals to achieve can have a profound impact on your financial success. What does your firm's current tech stack look like? How has technology impacted your work? I run a solo practice —having a solid tech stack is essential to running my business successfully, especially with back office responsibilities. Having a partner like Betterment helps me streamline client onboarding and ongoing investment support so I can focus on other aspects of my business. My firm's tech stack includes Betterment for Advisors as my custodian; G-Suite for all business functions; Asset-Map for initial client conversations; eMoney for complicated financial plans; Riskalyze for risk tolerance; Holistiplan for tax planning; AdvicePay for retainer client fees; Calendly for prospect/client bookings; Wealthbox as my CRM; Mailchimp for client communication and newsletters; Quickbooks for accounting; Canva for marketing and one page plan creation; Loom for custom client videos; and Adobe Acrobat for contract management and editing. How have the recent trends toward remote and hybrid work impacted your relationship with clients? I work with a lot of clients in tech and most have always been hybrid. Prior to the pandemic I was meeting with my clients virtually about 70% of the time. Now it's 100% virtual. It saves us both valuable time and money. What do you think is the biggest opportunity for advisors today? Automating their portfolio management and back office and focusing more time on truly helping clients align their resources with their life goals. Evidence shows that a more life-centered approach to financial planning can help clients make better decisions and improve financial wellbeing and life satisfaction. If you won the lottery, what would you do with the money? I'd love to give my family and close friends enough money to fund some of their dreams. Give to non-profit organizations focused on closing the racial wealth gap and climate change. Take our immediate and extended family on a big annual trip and pay for everyone. Hire a full time helper like Jeffrey from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air! Invest the rest wisely. If you could only give one piece of financial advice, what would it be? Prioritize your immediate goals and take action. For example, if a down payment is at the top of your goal list, then open an investment account and aggressively start saving.

    <p class="item-title">Betterment for Advisors Case Study Q&amp;A: How Ritholtz reaches a new client segment&nbsp;</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Betterment for Advisors Case Study Q&amp;A: How Ritholtz reaches a new client segment&nbsp; Feb 25, 2022 8:38:00 AM Dan Egan, Head of Behavioral Science at Betterment, recently interviewed Matt Lohrius, Advisor and CFP® at Ritholtz Wealth Management Matt Lohrius oversees the Liftoff platform at Ritholtz Wealth Management, which began leveraging Betterment’s platform more recently. Ritholtz is located in New York City and manages more than $1.2 billion in assets. Dan: Tell us about how the sort of robo-advisor aspect of things works within Ritholtz Liftoff. How do you guys organize it and think about it? Matt: As you probably know, our core business was focused on high net worth households, people that were staring down retirement or leading up to it. And we put out a lot of content—whether it's blogs or The Compound (our YouTube channel)—so a lot of people are following us and telling us they’d like to become clients. But many of them didn’t fit our traditional high net worth, pre-retirement customer profile. But clearly there was a demand, and we wanted to help these people. So that's why we created Liftoff, which we’ve continued to improve over the years. But it really blossomed once we started working with automated platforms like Betterment. There’s no minimum, so it’s great for people in their twenties or thirties who are maybe just starting to invest. Dan:Tell us a little bit more about Liftoff’s ideal client profile. Matt: There are a couple of different types. One would be someone who's on the younger side and who is in the accumulation stage base. They may not yet be married or have a family, but they’re starting to make money and they want to save in a smart way. This type of investor also wants access to an advisor for questions that do arise: around what they should be doing differently when they do get married or start having kids. I also love talking to people who have just graduated college, because they’re such enthusiastic followers of ours. We’re happy to accommodate them.&nbsp; Dan: This is obviously a big potential for growth. How do you think about growing Liftoff? Matt: I think we want to grow it as big as we possibly can and take it as far as we can. And that's kind of my mindset: I get on the phone with everyone who wants to chat. Hopefully we do get to the point where we need to bring more of me to oversee twice or three times as many Liftoff clients as we have right now. Dan: What have been the biggest hurdles to growth so far? Matt: One hurdle is that there's always going to be people out there that would rather just do it themselves and that's fine. We totally understand that. But there are still plenty of other people out there who don't even know where to start. And so we're looking to reach that group of people. Dan: Do you find that there is a catalyst that brings the self-directed types to you?&nbsp; Matt: Yeah, it could be a year like this one that we're in right now where people who have been investing on their own for a while reach out because of all the uncertainty. They are looking to get a little more advice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dan: Talk a bit about the culture within Ritholtz to new technologies. &nbsp; Matt: We're all about it. Outside of the Liftoff channel, Ritholtz is looking at technology to onboard clients more quickly and smoothly. We know it’s possible—with Betterment and Liftoff, you can open an account like that. So we want to be able to expand that kind of capability throughout our entire firm. And that really just involves us looking at all the technology we currently have to streamline the client experience. Dan: Can you talk a little bit about the difference that an automated platform like Betterment makes in your day? Matt: For Liftoff, it’s just huge from a technology standpoint: opening accounts, transferring money from other custodians, depositing money, linking a bank account. Everything is so easy and intuitive for the client. And that saves us a lot of time: we’re not having to help a client with the logistics of opening an account and can spend our time with them focusing on advice. That's where platforms like Betterment really excel, with the operational efficiencies. I think a lot of advisors hear “robo-advisor” and sometimes get a little turned off, but who doesn't want operational efficiency? And that’s on both sides of the equation to clients and advisors. Dan: What if you go back, what initially sparked the interest in convincing you to start using a robo-advisor as a partner? Matt: It’s kind of just set it and forget it. It's easy. You have a durable, long-term portfolio. You're going to invest in it just to keep saving. That's the work that you need to do, is constantly save. And outside of that, you don't need to do a whole lot. It's helpful for a lot of people. And when we do have a client ask “Can I do my own thing?"—because there’s often that temptation—we tell them “No, you can't.” That's the whole purpose and benefit of this. You can go somewhere else and do that. But if you want a concrete long-term plan, this is where you're going to get it, and it's very likely to work. Dan: What would you tell advisors who are skeptical about using a robo-advisor? How would you help them to understand how well it's worked for you and your clients? Matt: People who are skeptical need to realize that this is a hybrid platform. Yes, the portfolios and operations are automated, but you have access to an entire firm. Because if you have access to me, you have access to all the resources that I have access to. And that can be powerful.&nbsp; Dan: Last question. Does using an automated platform like Betterment mean that you, as a CFP®, as an advisor, get to spend more time on bigger issue questions like planning?&nbsp; Matt: Yes, one hundred percent. That is the whole reason Liftoff switched to Betterment. With the custodians we had been using previously, there were a lot more operational emergencies that needed our time and attention. But with a platform like Betterment, all of that is taken care of so that we at Liftoff can focus solely on providing quality advice. That's all we want to do here. Automation (through Betterment’s platform) is allowing us to do that now, which is why I'm confident that Liftoff will continue to grow. &nbsp; Ritholtz Wealth Management is a Registered Investment Adviser.

    <p class="item-title">Betterment for Advisors Case Study Q&amp;A: How Truepoint lowered the cost of serving more clients</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Betterment for Advisors Case Study Q&amp;A: How Truepoint lowered the cost of serving more clients Jan 27, 2022 11:30:00 AM Founded in 1990, Truepoint Wealth Counsel is an independent and nationally-recognized RIA based in Cincinnati, managing over $3BN in AUM and voted among the 2020 Top Workplaces by the Cincinnati Enquirer. Betterment’s Alex Choi recently sat down with Brad Felix, portfolio manager at Commas&nbsp;(formerly RhineVest), a subsidiary of Truepoint Wealth Counsel, to hear about how the firm has successfully leveraged the Betterment platform to grow the practice. Alex: Tell us a little bit about your practice and the factors that have contributed to your success. Brad: When RhineVest started in 2015, I realized how technology was changing the wealth management industry. Betterment was one of the disruptors driving that change, and we saw how the Betterment for Advisors (B4A) platform could lower an advisor’s operating costs. We wanted to leverage those cost savings to serve those who don’t necessarily have a million dollars (and that’s a lot of people).&nbsp; We've grown from 0 to 338 households since 2015. Growth was supercharged when Truepoint Wealth Counsel acquired our firm in 2016 and there’s been no looking back. Alex: How does Truepoint think about segmentation and where does Rhinevest fit in? Brad: Today, Truepoint’s True Wealth service offering represents our firm’s bread and butter where we provide tax and estate services. But we still want to serve other clients well and do right by them. So segmentation just makes sense, and the RhineVest/B4A combination offers a great solution. B4A and RhineVest started by serving clients with less than $1 million but is now starting to serve clients in the $1 to $3 million tier as well. Alex: What were some of the biggest hurdles you encountered while you were initially growing your business and how did you navigate those? Brad: I think the hardest thing for every new firm is distribution; and with the less than $1 million client segment, it can be a challenge to convince people that they need a financial planner. A lot of people feel like they don't qualify. So the first marketing push was letting people know that they had options beyond an insurance company or a bank, and that fee-only fiduciary advice was available regardless of how much money you have in your investment accounts. We tried to do that in a number of ways: a kind of radical, very transparent website that clearly showed pricing and the fact that we had no minimums. We created an edgy brand to show that we don't take ourselves too seriously and that everyone needs and deserves access to financial advice.&nbsp; We've also done some work around search engine optimization (SEO), focusing on keywords like “financial planner” and local searches in our Cincinnati geographic area. We like to rank well in those local searches and believe that our memorable brand and website helps us attract new clients. I think there's an advantage to being different when compared to lots of financial planners that kind of look the same. I would encourage others to define a unique message and lead with that because it does help you stand out. Although things were slow at first, at some point it just clicked. Delivering on your promises and serving clients well will get that flywheel going where they're telling their friends about the good experience they've had at your firm. Alex: Betterment has always been a big fan of your firm’s website. Can you talk a little more about your process for building that out and why you chose to include what you did? I think a lot of our clients aspire to build similar type sites and would appreciate how you went about it. Brad: I appreciate that. We worked with a really good local designer who pushed us to come up with a very simple message about why we were unique, why we were different.&nbsp; Our biggest goal for building out our site was transparency. We know that consumers are tired of landing on websites and still not being able to understand how much they would pay for something. We’re very clear, very upfront because in our minds this is the first stage of trust. We want people to talk to us, so our “let's talk''' button is all over our website. If the website conveys enough trust to get them to have a conversation, then we can be successful in moving them to the next stage to be a client. We're actually in the process of rebranding RhineVest and designing a new website. So, be sure to check it out - we think it's going to be even better than what we have now. We felt that Betterment had an attractive product so any chance we had to note our decision to utilize Betterment’s B4A offering and also to highlight how we're providing value to the client seemed to resonate with people. Alex: So how does RhineVest position Betterment for Advisors to its clients?&nbsp; Brad: We describe Betterment as our technology partner. Given Betterment’s increasing brand awareness, we talk about Betterment alongside Fidelity and Schwab, and people are comfortable. It’s part of our tech stack just like anything else. In addition, we're in the business of financial planning. It's what we do. In that vein, we've always viewed Betterment as a complementary partner, not a competitor. Alex: How do you price your offering, and how do you communicate your firm's pricing to clients? Brad: Our financial planning fee is $65 a month, but we also believe investment management is an essential part of the whole package. Our investment management fee is 80 basis points, which includes the Betterment fee. Alex: Does RhineVest leverage some of the client behavior functionality like goals-based planning modules and behavioral guardrails? Brad: Well, to be honest, the advantage of partnering with Betterment is that it also has a retail product and you put in the research to know what's a good feature, what's a good design choice, how do you get a better outcome, better behavior, etc. We honestly try not to interfere with the work you all do there and really just let the platform guide our clients and focus them on what we do best. We really spend most of our time on financial planning and just working through all the goals a client has set up in the Betterment system. Alex: Can you tell me some ways your practice has become more efficient?&nbsp; Brad: Very simply, the Betterment platform significantly lowers our cost of doing business. So account sign up, trading, cash management, those are all ways that we're not spending money on labor.&nbsp; We’re maybe unique among the firms that are using your platform in that we never intended to use Betterment as a solution only for children of our clients, but we now find that we can serve as many people as possible. Automation and efficiency are key to our profitability, because we provide great service at a higher client to advisor ratio vs. the industry. Alex: Could you just kind of take us through what the experience would be for a new client from when they hit your website to you guys actually opening and transferring their assets and where Betterment may fit into an onboarding workflow? Brad: The Betterment technology helps us to compress our onboarding cycle considerably, sometimes to as little as a day. At the end of an introductory client meeting, we send a welcome email that has a link to the questionnaire that helps us learn more about them, a link to open a Betterment account, and a link for our financial planning fee. The client signs our agreement as part of the automated Betterment signup process. Depending on what they fill out in the questionnaire, there may be additional automated follow-up. For instance, if they have certain held away assets, another email asks for more information. Once all the information is received, the advisor can then get a good look at their entire financial picture so that at the first financial planning meeting the conversation can focus on what's important to the client, rather than all the administrative details. Alex: What additional tools and automation do you employ along with Betterment?&nbsp; Brad: We subscribe to the “low code” or “no code” technology trend. The whole idea is that you don't have to be a developer to create automation between different systems. And that's really the whole premise of what we started experimenting with three or four years ago. We started using Zapier to tie together different pieces of our software. We use Typeform for our initial client questionnaire that we send out and that questionnaire is delivered by Mailchimp, which is a common email service. We also had a CRM at the time, so linking all those together. The basic discovery workflow started when a client booked a meeting through Calendly and then received the questionnaire. Ultimately that information would flow back into our CRM without our advisors doing anything. We were focused on determining how we can spend more time talking with clients and thinking critically while automating everything where human interaction doesn't add value. Alex: So it sounds like you’ve compiled a pretty big tech stack. Do you still find from a unit economics perspective that all those monthly subscriptions are saving you money? Brad: Yes. Our tech stack is not your typical financial industry tech stack. We're bucking the trend on what people say we should use and looking at other industries to find different, innovative tools. We’ve found that pricing for these non-industry tools is dramatically lower. We got rid of our CRM and now use Airtable, which I think everyone should check out. We use a client-to-advisor ratio to help us guide profitability. In a standard firm, this ratio is roughly 100 to 1. Even at 200 to 1, we would have profitable outcomes, but at 300 to 1, we’d feel really confident that creating business in this segment can deliver industry-like margins. It's just a different type of model. It's higher volume, perhaps less complexity, but requires a lot of efficiency to get there. The other metric of course is average account size, but the more efficiency you can create, the lower your average accounts can be. In full transparency, our first business plan assumed an average client balance of $100K. Over time we have far surpassed that. And I think it's only going up from here as we've realized this platform can be used to serve not only clients below a million, but in the $1 to $3 million range. Our average balance is only going up and we're only getting more efficient. Alex: What recommendations do you have for others thinking about how to build out their tech stack? Any resources you’d recommend? Brad: I typically recommend that before people look at available technology solutions, that they start with a whiteboard and draw what they need the technology to do. Then find the tools that fill that need.&nbsp; As far as resources, I’ve scooped up tons of information from #fintwit on Twitter. I think in this new economy that you don’t have to be a developer. For instance, you can build a website yourself much more cheaply than you could 10 years ago. And with subscription-based tech, you can find solutions that allow you to connect everything together yourself. The reality is the operating cost of running a business like ours over the last decade has declined substantially. But not everyone knows or realizes that yet. Alex: What would you tell advisors who might be skeptical of using a platform like a Betterment or someone else's? I think there's always skepticism around whether an algorithm can perform certain activities such as trading, rebalancing, and asset location. However, the contributions of an automated platform with impressive technology and execution can really shine during a situation like COVID, which came upon us so fast, but was met with industry high records of near-daily rebalancing of client accounts on certain high volatility days. Most human trading teams probably couldn't keep up with that pace. The other concern that advisors may have would be working with a lesser-known custodian. In my mind, custodians are more of a commodity at this point. It becomes a non-issue for most people once you educate them on what a custodian does, what they don't do, and what it really means to be somewhere else, while also articulating the advantages that they can give you. Finally, the Betterment UX provides people a clear, visual representation of their whole financial picture in a way that I don't think anyone's ever gotten with other online platforms or traditional custodians.&nbsp; Alex: Any parting comments? Brad: The one message I would like to tell everyone is don't just think about Betterment as a way to serve one segment of your existing high net worth business. Go out and build a business to serve the broader population because the market opportunity there is huge, there's no competition, and millions of people need financial advice. We hope that other advisors can learn from our experience in their consideration to utilize automated platforms and other tools. &nbsp; Disclaimer: This case study was conducted as a Q&amp;A in 2020 and is not reflective of all client experience, which may vary depending on individual circumstances not considered herein, and is not indicative of future or similar outcomes.

    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Advisor Spotlight: Katelyn Bombardiere, Commas Jan 25, 2022 8:58:06 AM For this Advisor Spotlight, we welcome Katelyn Bombardiere, CFP®, a Financial Planner at Commas, to chat about her passion for helping the everyday investor. Advisor: Katelyn Bombardiere Firm: Commas Bio: Katelyn Bombardiere, CFP®, is a Financial Planner at Commas, a fee-only financial planning firm based in Cincinnati. Katelyn started her career in the high-net-worth wealth management industry where she quickly realized her passion for helping the "everyday" investor. She sought a different approach to help people (like her friends, family and peers) without worrying about asset minimums. Firm Bio: We all don't have millions of dollars—but we all have goals. Commas is a financial advisory that provides fee-only service to the EveryInvestor: those who might not fit the standards set by traditional high-net-worth advisories but still deserve personalized financial guidance to meet their goals. We offer services with no account minimums, working with our clients at every step of the process and empowering them to create, plan, and achieve their desired money goals. We Are: Encouraging: 0% Judgment Trustworthy: Certified, Not Stuffy Purposeful: Fee-only for All Approachable: We Wear Jeans Why did you decide to become an advisor? As a sophomore in college, I was fortunate enough to go on a trip through the Leeds School of Business at The University of Colorado at Boulder. This trip took a group of students to over 10 different financial firms to introduce them to the possibilities of careers in finance. It was on this trip that I declared my major as finance and figured out that I wanted to be a wealth advisor. From there, I pivoted my internship and career choices to pursue my goal of becoming an advisor. What are some questions that you wish more clients would ask, and why? I think it is important for people who are looking for an advisor to know: if the advisor they are talking to is a fiduciary how that advisor is getting paid the investment philosophy and financial planning process the advisor follows what the advisor's qualifications are. I think gauging a sense of the advisor's passion is important too. You want to work with someone who is passionate about what they do, continues to learn, and shows an interest in you. What do you think is the biggest mistake people make with their money? Either they don't save enough, or they save but don't invest. Another big mistake is not understanding the difference between long-term investing in well-diversified funds and day trading. What does your firm's current tech stack look like? How has technology impacted your work? We utilize Betterment for Advisors as our custodian and Right Capital as our financial planning software. We have created our own CRM platform using Airtable which is a zero code cloud spreadsheet database. This tool allows us to customize our own portal where we house client data, tasks, meeting notes, and the client ledger (types of accounts, where they are held, contributions, notes, etc.). What makes Commas unique, however, is our internal automations through Zapier. For example, after our introduction meeting, the prospect is automatically sent an email with the next steps (signing up for our fee, completing a questionnaire and opening a Betterment account with our client agreements). Once they complete that step they are automatically sent another email asking them to upload documents to our secure portal. Those documents then file themselves into the correct client folder. The clients are then prompted to schedule our discovery meeting. This process continues all the way through the client onboarding process, and even when it comes time for generating annual reviews. These automations are what allows us to service our clients more successfully. They decrease the time we spend on busy work—account opening paperwork, filing documents, creating review outlines, sending template emails, etc.—and increase the amount of time we get to meet with clients and work on their financial plans. How have the recent trends toward remote and hybrid work impacted your relationship with clients? The remote work trend has only strengthened our client relationships as we were already well equipped from a technology standpoint. Our client meetings are generally 30 minutes to an hour, which is on the shorter side when looking at some other wealth management firms. I think our clients like the ability to have a quick meeting and get back to their day. They are just as busy as we are! This also allows us to work with clients all across the country. What do you think is the biggest opportunity for advisors today? To work with the everyday investors and show them that they are qualified to work with an advisor. You don't have to have thousands or millions of dollars to get good financial advice from a trustworthy source. This is also an opportunity to prove that fiduciary financial advisors are trustworthy professionals, not shifty sales people. If you won the lottery, what would you do with the money? Treat myself to a nice international vacation, set aside some funds for my closest friends and family (as long as they invest it for their futures), and invest the rest to ensure that I can attain all of my goals and retire comfortably. If you could only give one piece of financial advice, what would it be? If you are young, start investing today—even if it is $10/m! If you are older, still get started today! I also can't help but advise that you talk to a financial advisor (fiduciary!). Every single person's financial situation is different, and having the peace of mind that you are on track is so powerful. Yes, you can absolutely do this on your own, but do you have the time or passion to do it? Will you be 100% confident in your choices? If you are sick, you go to the doctor. If you have a toothache, you go to the dentist. If you have finances to manage (spoiler alert we all do), why not talk to a financial advisor?

      Getting started with Betterment for Advisors Oct 8, 2021 11:10:36 AM This guide is for investment professionals only. It is not intended for use by private investors. Your use of this website is governed by our&nbsp;Terms &amp; Conditions. Welcome to Betterment for Advisors. Our solution aims to save you time so you can serve more clients, more efficiently, with technology designed to streamline investment management. This guide walks you through the basic steps to get started and contains various resources to help you take advantage of all of the great features available on the platform Part 1:&nbsp;Advisor signup Uploading documents Agreement Automation Feature: If you decide to use this feature, your clients will experience a paperless account opening process. To take advantage of the feature, you will need to provide us with your Form ADV Part 2, Client Agreement, and Privacy Policy (if available). You would upload these documents in the “Agreements” tab of the advisor dashboard so that when the client goes through the signup flow, they will be able to view these documents and electronically sign them. You can learn more about our agreement automation feature, including important disclosure information, here. If you decide to use the Agreement Automation feature, we will display the date and time stamp, as well as the version of the agreement that your client electronically executed on the “Agreements” tab of the advisor dashboard. Those at your firm with “Compliance” access enabled will be able to access the electronic agreements of the firm’s clients through the Compliance page, under “Agreements”. If your agreements change, you can upload them to your firm’s account under the ‘Agreements’ tab so that they can be used for new clients going forward. Please note that Betterment will not automatically send the new terms for your existing clients to agree to; you must send any updated documentation to existing clients outside of the Betterment for Advisors platform. Logos You upload your firm’s logo in the “Settings” tab of the advisor dashboard and this will be used to brand the Client and Advisor Platform, as well as email communications to clients. Please upload a 400 x 100 PNG file and include a knocked out (white version) if available.&nbsp; Anyone with admin access can always update the logos by navigating to the Settings page and using the “Edit” button on the logos section. The default Betterment logo will be used until the firm’s logo is uploaded. Security You can view our security procedures here. Part 2:&nbsp;Fees and billing Betterment for Advisors combines a fixed monthly advisor fee with a platform fee based on your firm’s total AUM with us. The schedule is as follows: Fixed Fee:&nbsp;&nbsp;$150 per funded advisor per month PLUS&nbsp;a tiered wrap fee: Asset Range Wrap Fee $0-$2MM 20bps $2-$10MM 18bps $10-$30MM 16bps $30-$100MM 14bps $100MM+ 12bps &nbsp; NOTE: All of your Betterment assets will be charged the rate based on the tier your firm falls into. When a threshold is met, the wrap fee for your entire client base drops down to the reduced rate. We’ll assess your firm’s assets quarterly and make updates to the overall wrap fee based on where the firm falls at the end of each quarter. You have the ability to set a default advisory fee for your firm and then make adjustments to this fee for each client within your firm. Betterment provides you with the ability to charge an AUM-based fee, a flat fee, or a combined structure-based on tiers. For more information, please visit here. Clients are billed on a monthly or quarterly basis, and both your advisory fee and Betterment’s platform fee are taken directly out of the client’s Betterment account. Once the total fee has been taken out of the client’s account, we assess the amount of your firm’s fee and then initiate an ACH transfer to the firm’s bank account on file. To update the bank account on file, an admin of the firm may navigate to Settings &gt; Fees &gt; Edit. Fee calculation methodology Betterment accrues fees for the period beginning one day before the end of the prior month or quarter and ending two days prior to the end of the current month or quarter. Fees are calculated pursuant to this formula: [sum of the following for each day in the preceding month/quarter: (the balance in a client’s account at the end of the day) * (advisory fee applicable on that day)]. Fees will be realized by selling a portion of the client’s holdings on the last business day of the month or quarter to cover the accrued fee amount. This amount will then be deducted from the client’s account three business days after the transaction date, following the settlement of the resulting trade(s). Fees are billed in arrears and an ACH payment is sent to the advisory firm 2-3 weeks after the end of the month or quarter. &nbsp; Part 3: Client signup and reviewing your clients’ accounts Onboarding a Client The onboarding process is housed in the “Clients” tab within your advisor dashboard. Pre-populated Form: Select “Complete on your client’s behalf.” This will allow you to select the account type, portfolio strategy, and optionally pre-populate some of your client’s personal information. Once you complete the steps, your client will receive a secure link to access the new account workflow via email. They’ll have the chance to correct any pre-filled information and provide missing information during this process. Please note that this link will only be live for 14 days after the time it is sent for security reasons. Blank Form: Select “Share a link with my client.” You will find a unique token link, and you can either copy and paste to a site of your choosing or use the interface to send an email directly. If you send the email using our site, your client will receive a secure link to access the blank new account workflow (live for 14 days for security reasons) via email. If the client does not receive the email, it can be resent to the client by going to the “Clients” tab and resending the invite link. Joint and Trust Account Setup Process: If you would like to set up a Joint account or a Trust account for your clients, one of the clients will need to have an individual account first. Once the client has signed up for an individual account, you can initiate the opening of a joint or trust account on their behalf afterwards. Joint Account Setup Process: If you’d like to open a joint account on behalf of your clients, at least one of the two clients involved must have a personal account before creating the joint account. The personal account does not need to be funded, nor does it need to be linked to a bank account. For detailed steps on getting the account open, please visit here. Trust Account Setup Process: Advisors are able to add a trust account for any existing client with just a few clicks. If you’d like to open a trust account for a prospect, you’ll first need to invite them to open an Individual Taxable or any of the three available IRA accounts. Once the client opens the account they’ll appear in the Clients tab of your Advisor Dashboard. Then follow the steps detailed here to complete the process. Reviewing your Clients’ Accounts From the Clients page, you will be able to view an overview of your clients’ accounts by clicking a specific client’s name. Once you have clicked on the specific client, you will be able to see an overview of their account(s). On this page, you can also take actions on a client’s behalf (such as initiating withdrawals or deposits and updating allocations), or log in as the client to see their view of the dashboard. If you go to the Settings tab, you will also be able to edit the firm billing plan assigned to the client’s household. This page will also provide you with a bit more detail on each client’s goal(s), their specific allocation(s) and investment returns. Part 4: Client funding Clients can fund their accounts in four different ways: (1) linking an active checking or savings account, (2) wiring cash, (3) rolling over an existing IRA account, 401(k) account or other similar plans, and (4) transferring in eligible securities and cash from existing accounts using the ACATS system. Linking an active checking/savings account This process must be initiated by the client. The client needs to login to their Betterment account and navigate to Settings &gt; Funding accounts. They will then be guided to select a bank from our pre-populated list of common providers or by searching for their institution .If they select one of the listed providers, they will be prompted to enter their online banking username and password. If the client does not feel comfortable linking their account electronically or does not have an account with one of the providers listed, they may select the manual option and enter in the routing and account number for their bank account. Wiring cash Wire transfer instructions can be generated by the advisor and the client from the “Transfers” tab in the client portal. After you select the account, the instructions will be generated. The client will be able to do the same and have them emailed to themselves. Our support team can provide your firm with wiring instructions if you are unable to generate them or are having any issues. Rolling over and IRA account, 401(k), or other similar plan This process can be initiated by either the advisor or the client. We use the Direct Transfer method, which has no negative tax consequences. Advisors can generate paper rollover instructions by going to the client page in their advisor dashboard and clicking “Start a transfer.” Once generated, the rollover instructions will be emailed to the client with the advisor copied. The client can generate instructions by logging in to their account, and once logged on they will click on the “Transfer or Rollover” button and then “Rollover to Betterment.”.&nbsp; They will be prompted for the type of account, the name of the provider for the account, the account number, and the approximate balance in the account. Finally, they will electronically agree to our IRA terms. IRA: If the client’s account is not able to be transferred electronically, Betterment will generate an IRA transfer form that will be emailed to the client, which they can also access from their account’s Activity tab. This form will need to be signed by the client and then sent to the institution they are rolling over from. 401(k) and other retirement plan types: Once a client has agreed to the terms, they will be emailed specific instructions on how the rollover check needs to be made out, as well as where the check needs to be sent. Once they receive these instructions they will need to reach out to their provider and provide them with these instructions. ACATS Transfers Betterment supports ACATS transfers of many ETFs and mutual funds, select single stocks, and all USD cash positions. We’ve created an automated account transfer flow, which will ask you a series of questions on behalf of your client and ultimately determine if the account is eligible for an automated transfer. It’s possible that some of your client’s holdings are not currently allowed to be moved via ACATS. When prompted to add your client’s specific tickers, if any search returns a “No match” or you receive a notice that says the ticker is not supported, unfortunately, you’ll only be able to submit a PARTIAL TRANSFER REQUEST on behalf of your client for the supported tickers. Any requests submitted for a full transfer will be rejected. For any holdings that we cannot move via ACATS, you can direct your client to liquidate and then transfer the cash proceeds to Betterment. Any related tax implications should be discussed prior to making this recommendation to your client. Part 5: Dashboard basics: Understanding your advisor dashboard&nbsp; Summary Page This page provides a summary view of the advisor’s clients and their activities. It also includes a search field to access specific households. Weekly Net Deposits: This visual provides an overview of net inflows transacted into client’ accounts per week over the last 8 weeks. These values include withdrawals, deposits &amp; transfers in, auto-deposits, and rollovers. Hover over each week’s bar to view a breakdown of amounts for each of the categories listed. Total Balance: This visual provides a historic view of the advisor’s book value over the last several months and is reflective of the previous market day’s close. Clients Tab This page is where you can invite clients and track all existing clients. The “Invite Client” button on the right-hand side of this page will allow you to invite the client with a pre-populated or blank form. There is also a unique link on this page which you can send to clients to establish an account. Any person who uses this link to set-up an account will automatically be associated with your firm so you can manage the account. You will also collect an advisory fee for this account. Impersonation Feature: When you select a client’s name from the list, you will see a “Login” button to the right hand side, which will allow you to log in as the client. This is great for a remote service model or to help easily answer questions over the phone. Billing Feature: On the “Settings” tab within each household’s overview page, you will find an Edit button next to where the client’s fees are listed, which will allow you to apply a different billing plan made available by your firm’s administrator(s). The assigned billing plan will apply to all investment goals within the household. Portfolio Strategy Adjustment Feature: A similar Edit button will be available next to the client’s designated “Portfolio Strategy” where you are able to adjust the portfolio strategy assigned to each goal as well as the asset allocation (stocks/bonds). Agreements Page This page will display each client you have onboarded via the agreement automation feature. It will also allow you to view the version of the agreement your client electronically signed. If you upload updated documentation, please note that Betterment does not re-send these to existing clients. You will have to send the updated documentation to clients outside of the Betterment for Advisors environment. Support Tab This will provide you with contact information for our Betterment for Advisors support team for both you and your clients. Part 6: Resources&nbsp; We have a great FAQ section with more information and basic questions.

    <p class="item-title">Tax-Aware Migration Strategies</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Tax-Aware Migration Strategies Mar 10, 2021 12:00:00 AM Betterment for Advisors allows advisors to specify trading migration strategies to easily transition their clients’ portfolios or investment allocations. Betterment for Advisors allows advisors to specify trading migration strategies to easily transition their clients’ portfolios or investment allocations. Advisors have three options when migrating a client to a different portfolio or changing their allocation -- each with its own tax-optimization strategy. Advisors can preview the tax-impact effects of their elections before submitting the change.&nbsp; Three options are available, each with its own approach to managing the transition. Minimize short-term capital gains and wash sales When this strategy is selected, the client’s goal will be migrated in a tax-optimized way. For taxable accounts, we’ll seek to sell tax lots that are at a loss or have experienced long-term capital gains, but will continue to hold, when possible, tax lots with short-term gains until they either become long-term gains or become losses. For tax-deferred accounts, we will migrate without regard to embedded capital gains. Regardless of account type, we will prioritize avoiding wash sales that could lead to permanently disallowed losses for securities held at Betterment. For this strategy, it is important to remember that the account may weather high drift in the short run, but Betterment’s algorithms will typically rebalance available losses or long-term gains as they arise, as long as the security sales involved will not cause any permanently disallowed losses. Drift goal to target portfolio For this migration strategy, the client’s goal will be gradually drifted to the target portfolio by buying underweight securities with inflows / deposits through dividend reinvestments, and selling overweight securities to fund withdrawals. No securities will be sold as a result of this change.&nbsp; This election will often result in high drift, especially if the portfolio or allocation change involves a significant change in composition of the portfolio’s holdings. When “Drift goal to target portfolio” is selected, an additional election must be made to choose whether or not to turn off automated rebalancing. This is necessary because Betterment’s standard rebalancing algorithms operate independently of the migration strategy election. Choosing to disable automated rebalancing for the goals will ensure that a rebalance will not be triggered due to high drift that can be caused by selecting “Drift goal to target portfolio.” If the advisor elects to leave rebalancing on, Betterment’s automated rebalancing algorithm may take the opportunity to rebalance the goal shortly after the portfolio or allocation change is complete. The rebalancing algorithm avoids sales that realize short-term capital gains or would result in permanently disallowed losses for securities held at Betterment. Rebalance with no tax-impact constraints For this migration strategy, the client’s goal will be rebalanced as soon as possible to the target portfolio. Betterment will perform this rebalance in a tax-optimized way to the extent possible, but we will not delay selling shares even if doing so could lead to a more optimal tax outcome. Choosing this option could lead to the realization of wash sales for securities that have been recently sold. After trading is complete on the change, the account will typically be 100% in balance with the target portfolio. After any of these changes are applied, the strategy election remains active until a subsequent change is made. For each of these migration strategy options, Betterment’s Tax-Impact Preview feature is available so that the advisor may see an estimation of the effects of the selection.

    <p class="item-title">Advisor Insights from Lewer Financial</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Advisor Insights from Lewer Financial Mar 5, 2021 12:00:00 AM We recently sat down with the VP and Partner at Lewer Financial Advisors to understand more about his firm, his 401(k) practice, and how he came to work with Betterment. Nick Jenkins, VP &amp; Partner at Lewer Financial Advisors, partners with Betterment for Business to provide high-tech, low-cost 401(k) solutions to his clients. Can you briefly describe your advisory practice and the kinds of clients you serve? Nick: Lewer Financial Advisors is a part of Lewer Companies, a group of companies serving business owners, families, and individuals. We’re located in the Kansas City area, but we’re licensed in every state and do business across the country and in Canada. We aim to be a full-service, one-stop shop advisor for business owners often associated with franchise organizations, building relationships at the corporate level and becoming a preferred business services advisor to franchise owners—as individuals as well as employers. The services we provide can include individual wealth management, life insurance (both individual and employer-provided), estate planning, business succession planning, and health and wealth employee benefits. Lewer Benefits Group, LBG, focuses on the medical, dental, vision, and wellness benefits while Lewer Financial Advisors, LFA, focuses on the wealth side of the house, primarily retirement plans with an emphasis on 401(k)s. What motivated you to enter the 401(k) space? Nick: From the business standpoint, 401(k)s complement the other services that we're already providing to the franchise or business owner. Within our health and wealth benefit offering, the 401(k) plan is the largest component. We’re focused on business owners that are determined to grow their businesses and recognize the importance of recruiting and retaining their key employees.&nbsp; When you get in front of the right business owners, a 401(k) plan can represent significant assets, and the plan participants can represent dozens of prospective clients for insurance or other advisory services. We see the 401(k) as a great foundation to building a longer-term, multifaceted relationship. So do you actively prospect for 401(k) clients? Nick: No. We build the relationship first, then broach the topic of a 401(k) if and when it’s right for the client. We’ve had more success with this approach than by trying to peel clients away from someone else. How would you describe your role with respect to the employer and employees? Nick: It’s critical for us to maintain that relationship, so we are the main point of contact for employers and employees. We tell them we are their one-stop shop, their go-to expert on any topic related to their 401(k) plan. We want them to call us first, whether it’s the employee who needs help signing up online or downloading the app, choosing an investment, using the platform; or the business owner who needs help on plan design decisions such as which type of 401(k) plan to create, what vesting schedule to adopt, whether they should make matching or profit-sharing contributions. Anything like that.&nbsp; And of course we help employers understand compliance and regulatory requirements, including how to remedy any violations that may occur. Actually, many of those conversations start with the very first meeting once they express interest in offering a 401(k) plan. In just 30 minutes, we go over different plan types, matching, vesting, non-discriminatory testing, etc. We do this early in the process for two reasons: to demonstrate that we are experts in this area and to really expedite the process later on. And because of our relationship with them, we’re able to help guide them through these decisions. We already know a lot about their company, their culture, and their business objectives. So turning now to how you came upon Betterment, can you talk about that for a bit? Nick: I believe that we were one of the early Advisors working with Betterment through our growing list of individual clients on the Betterment for Advisors platform, but we’re fairly new to offering the Betterment 401(k). We looked at several providers before determining Betterment was the right 401(k) solution for our clients based on two main factors: the tech-forward platform and competitive pricing. When talking to business owners, I essentially tell them what Betterment for Business tells everyone: “We use the Betterment 401(k) platform to give you a tech-forward product at a good price — lower than what you’re going to find out there in the traditional market. Lower fees mean that employees get to keep more of their investment return. Oh, and by the way, Betterment’s other tools, such as the financial aggregation feature, lets you link all of your financial accounts to a single platform.” We let clients know that they may “just” be looking to provide a 401(k) to their employees, but that a 401(k) platform can be &nbsp; so much more in terms of total financial planning and having everything in an app on their phone. Advanced technology and accessibility are really cool. We haven’t looked back since starting to work with Betterment. Disclaimer: This case study was conducted as a Q&amp;A in 2021 and is not reflective of all client experience, which may vary depending on individual circumstances not considered herein, and is not indicative of future or similar outcomes.

    <p class="item-title">Betterment for Advisors Case Study Q&amp;A: How AdvicePeriod creates space and time to better serve clients</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Betterment for Advisors Case Study Q&amp;A: How AdvicePeriod creates space and time to better serve clients Sep 3, 2020 12:00:00 AM We recently sat down with Steve Lockshin, Founder of AdvicePeriod, to hear more about his firm and his perspectives on the benefits of working with Betterment for Advisors. AdvicePeriod is dedicated to focusing clients on the important decisions necessary to manage their wealth. With billions of dollars under management, the firm has repeatedly been recognized as one of the best places to work. In 2019 AdvicePeriod was named "Thought Leader of the Year" and in 2020 Steve Lockshin was named “Innovator of the Year” by WealthManagement.com. We recently sat down with Steve Lockshin, Founder of AdvicePeriod, to hear more about his firm and his perspectives on the benefits of working with Betterment for Advisors.&nbsp; Could you give us a little summary of AdvicePeriod?&nbsp; We're an RIA that believes most investments are a commodity and what matters most is planning and taxes. Our focus is on tangible results and leveraging technology.&nbsp; What have been some of the biggest hurdles or challenges that your firm has faced?&nbsp; I think it always comes down to people: getting the right people in the right seats. At the end of the day, this is still a service business. What are the key traits you look for in partner firms?&nbsp; Our partners are not firms but individual advisors at firms that often aren’t keeping up with technology or who don’t believe in active investing anymore. But the number one trait is they believe what we believe. They opt into our philosophy that investing is becoming more commoditized, with planning and taxes being more important. And then culturally, it’s important that they're a fit.&nbsp; How have you been able to use technology to help streamline your operations?&nbsp; For clients where Betterment fits, it’s super simple: account opening is simple, all the rebalancing is done, the tax loss harvesting is done. Opening an account takes less than two minutes at Betterment, so that really minimizes the intake process.&nbsp; At other firms, account opening can take 20 minutes. The workflow hasn't changed, largely because custodians remain the weakest link in the chain. It's still paper. It's still, “You need these forms for this account and these forms for this account. Oh, we gave you the wrong answer. You have to redo the forms.” Some will allow electronic signatures, some won't. It's just a nightmare trying to figure out how to open accounts.&nbsp; Why were you early adopters of Betterment’s platform?&nbsp; It's because we saw the ability to create time. In fact, as one of my good friends always says: “In sports, when you're on offense, you're supposed to create space and when you're on defense, you reduce space.” And if we're theoretically on offense, trying to grow our business and help more people, then creating time and creating space is of tremendous value. And that's what the platform did for us.&nbsp; I think that the tax loss harvesting feature is capable of being a big benefit to our clients. I’m still amazed at how few people understand the benefits of tax-loss harvesting. I show clients how they didn't just get the stated investment return. A client could get an additional 50-100 basis points per year from tax loss harvesting. I think it's also important in a rapidly changing environment that advisors remain on the cutting edge. Utilizing a more forward-thinking company like Betterment that is constantly deploying new technology to improve the client and advisor experience is extremely valuable.&nbsp; For which kinds of clients is a platform like Betterment a good fit?&nbsp; For us it’s a good fit where estate planning is not a key focus. It's typically super easy for smaller accounts, but there’s no size limitation. I think our largest account on the Betterment platform is $40 million, so it works just fine for large accounts where we don't have estate planning complexity.&nbsp; How have you helped advisors you partner with get over any skepticism they might have about Betterment?&nbsp; The biggest issues are inertia and the fear of being marginalized. But advisors who are open to new technology and who are looking for efficiencies have no problem. Betterment is all about simplicity and creating time that the advisor can use more productively for the benefit of clients. Advisors have to have confidence in what they’re doing and believe that they’re adding value in different ways. I often use a gym analogy. Clients can get in shape on their own for cheap. But if they want a personal trainer, they know it’s going to cost more. That's similar to our role as advisors, and we shouldn’t feel defensive about trying to justify that.&nbsp; Have you ever had a client leave your firm to do it themselves on Betterment retail? Never, not one. It's actually been the opposite. People will say, “Oh, I have a Betterment account, can I move it over to you guys so you can oversee it?” So we've had a lot of Betterment retail accounts come on to AdvicePeriod, but we haven't seen it the other way around.&nbsp; Besides Betterment, what other technologies are you using that others may not be? I remain amazed at how many firms deploy portfolio management systems and performance measurement systems and still crank out PDF reports when they can just give the client a portal. We’ve organized all of the important documents and give clients 24/7, transparent access to everything so they can see what’s happened over time from both the planning and portfolio perspectives. Our rollout of Vanilla is a big tech change. Even someone like me, who's super planning focused, had overlooked some very important aspects to being fully prepared with things like healthcare and financial powers for my adult children. Are you seeing an uptick in ESG or SRI requests from clients?&nbsp; No, but I did read one of the big reports that basically said that something like 60% of people are asking about ESG right now. But we’re not seeing it. And the challenge I have with ESG is it reduces predictability because you increase tracking error. So I've always encouraged people to take the extra money they earn from their high confidence of having a properly allocated portfolio and apply it directly to the charities you care about. But we'll see where things go. There's certainly more social awareness today than there was five years ago.&nbsp; Are there any specific areas that you think custodians should be focusing on for the next few years?&nbsp; People should be able to move their accounts like they change their cell phone numbers. So I'd love to see custodians do that. Also: access to data. But instead of opening up data access, they're starting to close it down again. Ease of account opening. I mean, Betterment's been around since 2010 for retail customers, so online account opening in less than two minutes has been around for some time. We're going on the 10th anniversary of being able to open your accounts online and the major custodians still can't do it. So is it that they can't or they won't or both?&nbsp; One last question: any pearls of wisdom for new advisors who are just starting out?&nbsp; There’s an old saying in counseling that “you can't be a guide to a place you've never been.” So I would tell everyone to open an account with your own money—not just $10 that you ignore, but enough money so that you pay attention to it. If you're not using the system yourself, then it's hard to say it's good or bad.&nbsp; Don't be afraid that engaging a platform like Betterment may lose you clients. Find things that make you look better and do a better job for the client. And if you're not using tax loss harvesting in your practice, you're not doing the best job you can for your taxable clients.&nbsp; Disclaimer: This case study was conducted as a Q&amp;A in 2020 and is not reflective of all client experience, which may vary depending on individual circumstances not considered herein, and may not apply to all clients, as past experience is not indicative of future or similar outcomes.&nbsp;

    <p class="item-title">Betterment for Advisors Goal Projection and Advice Methodology</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Betterment for Advisors Goal Projection and Advice Methodology Dec 4, 2019 12:00:00 AM Details on how projections work within Betterment for Advisors' client accounts. Betterment provides allocation, savings and withdrawal advice alongside a projection graph when customers view their goal projection under “Plan.” The graph is intended to show the possible future investment values in order to illustrate the impact of different contribution and withdrawal choices, investment time horizons, and portfolio allocations. Actual individual investor performance has varied and will continue to vary depending on market performance, the time of the initial investment, amount and frequency of contributions or withdrawals, intra-period allocation changes, and taxes. An indication of “On Track” is not a guarantee of achieving a goal in the future. Acting on savings and withdrawal advice is not a guarantee that goals will be met or that the investment will meet cost-of-living needs throughout one’s life. See our Terms and Conditions. In the following sections, we’ll provide an overview of our methodology and assumptions for each component under “Plan” in a Betterment goal. Projection Methodology and Assumptions The expected portfolio returns used in the portfolio value projection results are based on the expected returns and risk-free rate assumptions for your target Betterment portfolio allocation. (See more about how the expected returns are derived). This portfolio is set by the user-selected allocation to “stocks” and “bonds”. The allocation choice corresponds to weights of the underlying Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), as defined in our Portfolio. The recommended allocation mix is based on user investment profile including age, the goal type, and time horizon. Monthly Contributions or Withdrawals, if specified, are assumed to be made at the end of the month. We project your balance in monthly increments, never going below twelve months. We project allocation changes on a monthly basis. For users with remaining goal terms of less than one year, our projection assumes that you maintain the allocation at the end of the goal term rather than liquidate. We sometimes map external assets to proxy assets. For investments with available data, we map holdings to our asset classes to make approximate projections of their expected risk and return. In some cases we do not have data for a specific investment, usually because the holding is a non-publicly-listed vehicle, such as a private 401(k) plan. In those cases, we use proxy tickers to determine the appropriate asset class exposures. Proxy tickers are provided by Quovo, our third-party data provider for synced external accounts. Quovo uses a proprietary process to identify similar public securities to the unknown ticker using structural information (including security type and fund name) and to qualify the confidence level of the similarity. Betterment uses Quovo’s proxy tickers only for securities that pass a threshold confidence level of similarity. Quovo’s methodology may change over time, and Betterment will continuously evaluate any such changes. Fee Assumptions There are two relevant fees for projections: (1) the Betterment platform fee (“Betterment fee”); and (2) the Advisor’s fee. Both the Betterment fee and Advisor’s fee can be found on the Settings page, under the Account tab. Betterment assumes that both fees applicable on the date the projection is displayed will remain the same through the entire projection term. For projections, Betterment calculates an effective fee that is a sum of the Betterment fee and the Advisor’s fee. For projection purposes, Betterment converts each Advisor’s fee into an effective fee rate expressed as a percentage of client assets. This Advisor’s effective fee rate is calculated using one of the following methods, depending on how the Advisor’s fees are structured: If the Advisor uses a constant asset based rate as their fee (e.g., 0.25% / year), Betterment uses that rate as the effective fee rate in its projections. If the Advisor uses a flat fee, Betterment calculates the effective fee rate as the flat fee divided by the balance of the household assets held with the Advisor at Betterment. For example, if a client has $50,000 of advised assets with an Advisor, and that Advisor charges a flat fee of $100 per year, Betterment calculates the effective fee as ($100 / year) / ($50,000) = 0.2% / year. If the Advisor uses a tiered fee system with a series of asset-brackets and marginal rates, Betterment calculates the effective fee rate by multiplying the amount of advised dollars in each bracket by the marginal rate, summing those values and dividing by the total advised dollars. For example, if an Advisor charges a tiered rate of 0.25% / year for the first $100,000 of advised dollars and 0.15% / year thereafter, and an advised client holds $150,000 with that Advisor at Betterment, Betterment calculates the effective fee as ((0.25% / year * $100,000) + (0.15% / year * $50,000)) / $150,000 = 0.217% / year. As a unified example, let’s assume that the Betterment fee is 0.25% per year. Further assume that an Advisor charges a flat fee of $500 / year and that the advised client has $100,000 of assets held with the Advisor on Betterment’s platform. The overall effective fee assumed for projections is then 0.25% / year + ($500 / year) / ($100,000) = 0.75% / year. Savings Advice Methodology and Assumptions The monthly contributions estimate is based on a 60% likelihood of the portfolio value reaching the goal target at the end of the investment term. Calculations assume the current&nbsp;portfolio. If the portfolio changes over time or has different expected returns, outcomes may be adjusted. Calculations will be updated based on the current portfolio held. Savings advice and graphs are in nominal terms. Withdrawal Advice Methodology and Assumptions The monthly safe withdrawal is based on a 96% likelihood of having $0 or more at the end of the time horizon, assuming the following assumptions hold true. The safe withdrawal amount assumes the user adjusts the withdrawal rate and allocation according to our advice at least once per month. The safe withdrawal amount assumes the user does not live past the specified time horizon (“plan-to-age”). Calculations assume the current portfolio. If the portfolio changes over time or has different expected returns, outcomes may be adjusted. Calculations will be updated based on the current portfolio held. Withdrawal advice and graphs are in real terms, using an inflation rate of 2%. The default time horizon (“plan-to age”) is 90 years of age, or age + 50 years if younger than 40, or age + 10 if older than 80. The model will use this value or the value entered by the user. Graph Explanation The Graph exhibits the possible range of projected portfolio values using color. The dark line indicates the projected portfolio value under average market conditions. This means that there is a 50% likelihood of portfolio values greater than this and a 50% likelihood of portfolio values less than this. The lighter, shaded region indicates the range within which there is 80% likelihood of the projected portfolio value. This means that there is a 10% likelihood of portfolio values greater than the top of this region, and a 90% likelihood of portfolio values at least as high as the bottom of this region. Goal Status (Savings Goals) – On Track or Off Track The Betterment Savings Advice tool constantly tracks the portfolio performance and indicates the ability of the portfolio to reach the Goal target, assuming average market performance. The portfolio performance is categorized as “On Track” or “Off Track”, and Betterment makes recommendations to increase the likelihood of reaching the Goal target. The portfolio performance is “On Track” when the total projected portfolio value exceeds the Goal target assuming average market performance. This is equivalent to a likelihood of 50% and above of reaching the Goal target. The portfolio performance is “Off Track” when the future projected portfolio value (i.e. current balance plus future contributions, plus investment growth) is not sufficient to reach the Goal target assuming average market performance. This is equivalent to having less than 50% likelihood of reaching the Goal target. Betterment provides advice for bringing the goal back on track in three areas – either increasing the amount of future monthly contributions, or increasing the term of the investment or increasing the current balance in the account by making a one-time deposit. These recommendations are based on a relatively conservative stance, e.g. a 60% likelihood of projected portfolio value to reach the Goal target, compared to the 50% chance used by other models. Limitations The Goal target is a user input and may not be sufficient to provide income for actual spending or retirement income needs. The model does not account for any taxes, except for retirement goals. All non-retirement goal values are assumed to be pre-tax. The model does not account for forced withdrawals such as Required Minimum Distributions that must be taken from pre-tax qualified retirement accounts after a certain age. The model does not account for auto-deposits that are skipped. The savings model is in nominal terms and therefore does not have a direct inflation assumption. (The withdrawal model is in real terms, and uses a 2% inflation assumption). The withdrawal model does not take into account other sources of income outside the Betterment account. A full income plan should include all sources of income and a spending needs analysis. Past performance is not indicative of future results. These projections do not guarantee investment performance. Extreme market conditions, sustained high inflation, or other unforeseen events may reduce portfolio value and withdrawals. Income is not guaranteed.

      Advisor Spotlight: Paul Sydlansky, Lake Road Advisors Jun 18, 2019 12:00:00 AM For our second Advisor Spotlight, we welcome Paul Sydlansky,&nbsp;founder of Lake Road Advisors, an independent, fee-only financial planning firm. Advisor: Paul Sydlansky Firm: Lake Road Advisors Bio: Paul Sydlansky, founder of Lake Road Advisors LLC, has worked in the financial services industry for over 20 years. Prior to founding Lake Road Advisors, Paul worked as a relationship manager for a Registered Investment Adviser. Previously, Paul worked at Morgan Stanley in New York City for 13 years. While at Morgan Stanley, Paul was a senior-level manager within the Institutional Equities Department. In 2018, he was named to Investopedia's Top 100 Financial Advisors list. Paul received a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Marist College and holds an MBA from New York University Leonard N. Stern School of Business. Paul is a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ and a member of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) and the XY Planning Network (XYPN). Firm Bio: Lake Road Advisors LLC is an independent, fee-only financial planning firm, specializing in working with mid-career professionals to help make sure they are making the right decisions to live a smart financial life today as well as tomorrow. Why did you decide to become an advisor? There are really 3 main reasons why I decided to become a financial planner. First, I work in a field I have been interested in my entire life (finance/business/markets). Second, I get tremendous satisfaction from helping people feel confident in their own financial lives. Third, it allows me the flexibility to build my own schedule and spend time with my family. What are some questions that you wish more clients would ask, and why? I would like to see more clients ask about systems and techniques for developing better financial habits. There are no secrets or shortcuts to building wealth; it happens over time due to consistent and disciplined action. What do you think is the biggest mistake people make with their money? Having no financial plan at all for spending, saving, or investing. What is the biggest money mistake you’ve ever made? Too much Real Estate exposure in 2008-2009 as a percentage of my net worth. What does your current technology stack look like? Betterment &amp; Vestwell for Investing, MoneyGuidePro and The First Step Cash Management System for Planning, Riskalyze for Risk, Wealthbox for CRM, and Calendly for scheduling. How is technology impacting the way you and your clients interact? Technology allows me to more efficiently and cost effectively serve my clients. Which do you prefer: Billions, Wolf of Wall Street, or The Big Short? Billions. I spent the first part of my career working with hedge funds and they do a tremendous job of putting you into that world. If you won the lottery, what would you do with the money? Definitely complete my current financial goals but I would absolutely need to sit down and reevaluate my personal goals. I wouldn't just retire because I really enjoy what I do. What do you think is the biggest opportunity for advisors today? Changing the way we are viewed as an industry. Often advisors and brokers are viewed as predatory and untrustworthy. We have a chance to really change the landscape and make the business more about helping people figure out their financial lives and have a plan, and less about selling products. If you could only give one piece of financial advice, what would it be? Start investing as much as you can as a percentage of your income as early as you can (I would aim for 20-30%).

    <p class="item-title">Advisor Spotlight: Devon Klumb, RhineVest</p>
    

    
    <div class="js-post-body-count" aria-hidden="true" hidden>
      Advisor Spotlight: Devon Klumb, RhineVest Feb 20, 2019 12:00:00 AM For our first ever Advisor Spotlight, we welcome Devon Klumb, Financial Planner at RhineVest. For our first ever Advisor Spotlight, we welcome Devon Klumb, Financial Planner at RhineVest, a fee-only financial planning firm based in Cincinnati. Advisor:&nbsp;Devon Klumb, CFP®, BFA™ Firm:&nbsp;RhineVest Bio:&nbsp;Devon Klumb, CFP®, BFA™ is a Financial Planner at RhineVest, a fee-only financial planning firm based in Cincinnati. He started his career as a commodities trader and transitioned to financial advice and planning out of a commitment to help his family, and people like them, develop better financial habits. Firm Bio:&nbsp;RhineVest was created to bring fee-only, fiduciary advice to the people who need it most. We’re the outcasts. We never fit in at the banks, the insurance companies, or other investment firms. We’re the ones who couldn’t ignore our conscience to sell lucrative financial products. All of us believe there’s a better way. That’s why we exist. Our Q&amp;A with Devon Why did you decide to become an advisor? The short answer: It was kind of decided for me. I went to college for Industrial Engineering because I thought that earning an engineering degree would give me the ability to wiggle my way into any job I wanted. All I needed was an interview. Pretty arrogant, right? Totally, but, it worked. I took a job out of school trading commodities in Omaha, NE. No, Warren Buffett had nothing to do with me becoming an advisor (though, I did eat at the same McDonalds as him many times). In fact, I'm not sure that I would have found myself in this position had my wife not begged that we move back to Cincinnati. Around this time, my dad convinced my wife and I to attend Dave Ramsey's 'Financial Peace University' course. The classes were on Saturday mornings at 8am at a local church... for like 8 weeks straight. I still can't believe we did that! Now, I love my parents, but their financial track-record wasn't something you'd aspire to. And wouldn't you know it, my wife and I were awful with our money, too. Only, I had no idea that was the case until we went through this course. The synopsis of our experience: our money was not going to places that reflected our values and an immediate change was necessary. I essentially became obsessed with reversing the trend of poor financial habits in my own family, which led to a deeper obsession with helping others do the same. So, I did the only logical thing a commodities trader with an Engineering degree living in Omaha could do. I quit my job and moved back to Cincinnati to be a financial advisor. As I said, it was kind of decided for me. What are some questions that you wish more clients would ask, and why? "How can we get better at delaying gratification?" This is by far the most obsolete principle in our consumer-centric society. Ironically, this is, in my opinion, the key to building wealth. What do you think is the biggest mistake people make with their money? Spend it on things that don't actually make them happy. Or, save it for things that they don't actually care about. What’s the biggest money mistake you’ve ever made? Oddly enough, the worst financial decision I've ever made resulted in the most rewarding experience I've ever had. At 24, I decided to leave my high-paying commission job and start a fee-only financial planning firm with a friend. This was no bueno for the old savings account, especially as we would soon learn that my wife was pregnant with our son, Jack. BUT, what an incredible journey I've been afforded the opportunity to trek since making that decision. Should I have been more 'financially stable' before making the leap? Yes, absolutely. Would I do it again. Yes, absolutely. What does your current technology stack look like? You name it, we use it. Wealthbox, Zapier, Betterment for Advisors, Slack, Google (Drive, Mail, Calendar), RightCapital. How is technology impacting the way you and your clients interact? The use of technology allows us to serve smaller balance clients more effectively. It's also allowing us to serve far more clients than we ever thought possible. Most importantly, technology is allowing us to spend more time with clients on issues that can't be solved with algorithms and less time pushing paperwork. Which do you prefer: Billions, Wolf of Wall Street, or The Big Short? The Big Short If you won the lottery, what would you do with the money? Keep enough to cover education costs for our kids and give the rest away. Though, if we're being totally honest, I'd probably use up a small chunk trying to find some way to play a round at Augusta National... just one. What do you think is the biggest opportunity for advisors today? I think the biggest opportunity today is authenticity. Investors have been burned over the years, badly. They are less inclined than previous generations to trust you just because you have some letters after your name. The BS detector is strong with this one (Yoda voice). If you're here for the right reasons, your clients and prospects can tell. If you’re not, they will notice soon enough. Technical advice is becoming a commodity. Candor and behavioral accountability are among the greatest opportunities we have to impact the lives of our clients. If you could only give one piece of financial advice, what would it be? "Let’s admit it, we all got two wolves in us, a good one and a bad one, you know what I’m talking about — and they BOTH wanna eat… We just gotta feed that good wolf a little more than the other one." - Matthew McConaughey We all make mistakes. What separates those who succeed (financially or otherwise) from those who ultimately fail is the ability to acknowledge their OWN faults and make adjustments moving forward. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. If you struggle to break those habits, find someone who can help.
